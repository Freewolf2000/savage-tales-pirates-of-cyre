Nathaniel Sullivan found it in the pocket of a dead pirate washed up on shore several years ago. Realizing the map showed the area round Bristo he half-heartedly went looking for the treasure but found nothing of interest. He keeps it above the bar because the locals enjoy discussing the possibility that a cache of buried treasure lies close to the village. He won’t sell the original but allows the heroes to trace it for 10 pieces of eight.</p>\n<p>Reaching the spot marked on the map requires three days’ march into the mountains. On the third day the group descends into a wooded valley.</p>\n<p>The “X” marked on the map covers half of a large area with no clues to refine the search further. Four points of interest lie within the marked area. The searchers see the ruined house first—spotting the other features requires a successful Notice roll and an hour of searching.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruined House:</strong> Standing in a small clearing is a ruined farmer’s cottage. Most of the roof is intact, though the doors and shutters have been removed. Have each character make a Common Knowledge roll. On a success he recognizes it for what it is—Cuwayo is dotted with similar structures, built by visitors hoping to make an honest living from the land. It has been abandoned for two years and shows no sign of recent habitation.</p>\n<p><strong>Grave Marker: </strong>Behind the house on land partially reclaimed by the forest is a solitary standing stone marked with a faded skull and crossbones. A name is scratched beneath the symbol but it is too weathered to read. The stone is a red herring—a group of pirates used the house as shelter for a while and erected the stone to pass the time.</p>\n<p>Of course, the heroes may decide to start digging nearby in the hope of finding treasure. There is absolutely nothing to be found here— after two hours of hard digging the heroes reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Blackened Tree: </strong>To the east of the house stands the remains of a shattered tree, its charred stump a clear indication it has been struck by lightning at some point. The pirate treasure lies just in front of the tree.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, a family of monkapes live nearby and take a dislike to the group disturbing their peace. As soon as the heroes begin digging a rain of coconuts descends from the surrounding trees.</p>\n<p>Excavating the treasure takes 12 hours. Each success and raise on a Strength check reduces this by one hour, to a minimum of three hours. When the heroes reach the bottom they discover a skeleton clad in rotting clothes and clutching a cutlass that looks brand new. Beneath the skeleton is a small chest. The first time a hero touches either the skeleton or the cutlass the skeleton’s eyes flash alive, glow bright red, and an unearthly cackle emerges from his gaping mouth, “Cursed ye be for stealing my treasure! Cursed! Cursed! May the flesh rot off your bones!”</p>\n<p>Anyone witnessing this scene must make a Fear check. This is in fact a magical effect meant to deter grave robbers and is purely for show. Ask for Spirit rolls to maintain the illusion of there being a curse, however.</p>\n<p>Monkapes (4): Four of the beasts cavort nearby (p. 192).</p>\n<p>Booty: The cutlass is enchanted and bestows +1 damage and Parry to its wielder. The chest contains 3,000 pieces of eight and a golden triangle covered in strange writing.</p>\n<p><strong>Mysterious Bald Spot:</strong> A hundred yards south of the ruined farmhouse is a patch of ground measuring five feet to a side that has been cleared of surface vegetation, leaving only bare soil.</p>\n<p>Excavating this site requires five hours less one hour per success and raise on a Strength roll (minimum of 1 hour). Once the area is cleared the heroes find a chest.</p>\n<p>Booty: The chest contains 200 pieces of eight, four powder bombs, and 20 rounds of gunpowder and shot wrapped in oilskins. This is not the treasure the heroes seek but a stash hidden recently.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.AYEa0alCeerUM4co"},"cf":{"id":"temp_4s6bxi84dvu","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Savage Tales#/CF_SEP/The Dragonshards","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"1wDPwmYHycHkdBls","name":"Jewel of the Deep","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Jewel of the Deep</h1>\n<p>The characters are sailing through Kraken Bay when they chance upon a floating derelict. A terrible monster lurks aboard. But the treasure it guards is far more dangerous, for concealed within it is an entity that hungers to control men like puppets.</p>\n<p>This tale works best when there are more lives at stake, perhaps while the characters are aboard a passenger ship or hired on as mercenaries for some merchant vessel. This will also work best in the Scions Sea or Kraken Bay.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Sixty years before, <em>Daughter of Cyre</em> left Cyre for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}. Aboard was the Overlord of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre]{Cyre's} youngest daughter and all her worldly goods, for she and her dowry had been promised to the ruler of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}. Unfortunately, <em>Daughter of Cyre</em> was separated from its escort during a great storm and never made port. Many assume she sank with all hands, though others have long speculated that she was attacked and scuttled by pirates.</p>\n<p>Many Cyreans know the name of <em>Daughter of Cyre</em> and the great treasure lost along with the lovely young woman, although her beauty and the amount of wealth she carried with her have likely grown in the intervening years. Allegedly she carried chests gleaming with a riot of gems and gold, and great heaps of pearls. What no one knows is that there was yet another passenger aboard <em>Daughter of Cyre</em>, an ancient entity who feeds upon the minds of men.</p>\n<p>At rest, with its illusion fully in place, the death jewel resembles a golden chest about two feet long, set with cloudy jewels. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre]{Cyre's} Overlord of two generations ago was well-acquainted with its power, having drawn it from the sealed vaults deep in Cyre where ancient spells held it in thrall. He intended to unleash it upon the aristocracy of Karrnath.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the people of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}, <em>Daughter of Cyre</em> sank with all hands, and after a long while the case housing the creature rotted enough that its sorcerous wards failed and the being crept free. Now it hungers.</p>\n<p>A sapphire ring mixed in with the treasures remaining aboard ship grants immunity to the creature’s assaults—it was intended to have been worn by the Overlord’s daughter, who would have used her immunity to assume command of the kingdom and welcome Cyrean wizards from across the Inner Sea to quell “the sorcerous plague”—in reality the attacks unleashed by the entity.</p>\n<p>As the adventure begins, the entity has just depleted decades worth of stored sorcerous strength to raise the derelict from where it rests, so it can enter the world of men and feed. It is particularly eager to wreak vengeance on the people of Cyre.</p>\n<h2>The Derelict</h2>\n<p>As their ship crosses the Inner Sea one misty morning the characters spy the masts of another vessel looming through the fog. As the characters draw closer they notice that the ship lacks canvas, and many of the spars are broken and hang at odd angles. Moreover, the ship is absolutely silent—there’s no one talking or moving aboard, and certainly no one there answers hails.</p>\n<p>If the characters draw within a few hundred feet, the fog’s thin enough to see there’s no one aboard. Seaweed and other vegetable matter clings to the listing vessel, and portions of the rail and prow are broken away. She rides low, as though she’s taken on water, but she doesn’t seem to be sinking.</p>\n<p>A Knowledge (Naval history) or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Boating]{Boating} (−2) roll reveals that the ship appears of an older make, a Cyrean merchant with a high prow and forecastle of a sort that was popular generations ago.</p>\n<p>The name on the prow is partly obscured by grime and muck, but astute characters can make out the name <em>Daughter of Cyre</em> after a little bit of study, and any Cyrean who makes a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge} roll is aware of the vessel’s sad history and reputed treasure. Characters who wish to board should probably take a rowboat over. A soggy ladder is built into <em>Daughter of Cyre’s</em> starboard side, on the other side of the vessel from the characters. If they don’t circle the ship before boarding they have to toss over lines, or climb up themselves.</p>\n<p>If the characters do circle the ship, with a successful @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} (−2) they see there’s a long rent in the ship above the waterline near the prow, right about where the forward cargo bay would be. The detail is hidden by the fog and draped seaweed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Image:</span> @Compendium[savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-tales.Derelict Ship]{Derelict Ship}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Boarding the Daughter of Cyre</h2>\n<p>The deck is hidden under a coat of seaweed and other detritus, where expiring fish lay goggle-eyed and twitching. The timbers of the ship itself are soggy and the planks creak, though they are sturdy enough to support the characters. The ship’s boats are aboard and rotting, so whatever happened didn’t give anyone a chance to get away. Worse, a character who succeeds on a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} roll hears an occasional scrabbling sound from belowdecks. Something down there is moving, although the sound stops before they can get a clear fix on where it is.</p>\n<p>There’s nothing on the main deck that’s remotely worth salvaging. There are rotten barrels and moldering rope and rusted winches and gyves, and a whole lot of smelly, dying sea life.</p>\n<p>There’s not much to see above decks. Now that the characters are aboard they can better tell that the deck house is badly damaged and missing most of its roof. Only the captain’s cabin is relatively intact.</p>\n<h3>The Captain’s Cabin</h3>\n<p>The door hangs ajar, and creaks as it’s opened wide enough for the characters to investigate the fish-scented darkness. The moment they step in farther or shine light within, a tentacle sways up from behind the shattered wreck of the captain’s table. An octopus lies dying behind the furniture, and perishes before it can do much more than frighten the characters.</p>\n<p>The cabin is a complete shambles, but there are chests to open. Two are waterlogged and contain moldy rags that were once clothing. A third contains half-a-dozen bottles of wine, still sealed, each worth 50 golden galifars, white wine of the famed Ketner and Mohr vineyards.</p>\n<p>There’s a wreck of a desk built into one bulkhead. Rolled-up maps shoved into cubbyholes above the desk have long since disintegrated to all but useless pulp. Hidden in the desk drawers in a locked drawer is an eelskin pouch, tightly sealed. The lock itself is not especially complex, but it’s rusty and the wood is swollen, so characters must either succeed at @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} (−2) or break in with brute force (the desk has a Toughness of 6).</p>\n<p>Characters familiar with sea travel can make @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge} rolls to be aware of expensive eelskin pouches, which are designed to keep important documents watertight.</p>\n<p>The captain’s log book is within. A few generations of submersion have managed to get through even the fine eelskin and the log book’s quite moist. It remains intact, though, and if carefully dried, the final pages, midway through the journal, can be read. A successful @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Smarts} roll should suggest this if the players themselves don’t realize this. Trying to read the information now will simply destroy it.</p>\n<p>All else within the captain’s cabin is sodden and rotting.</p>\n<h3>The Main Hold</h3>\n<p>A ladderless hole leads down to the main hold, so characters must either drop a rope and climb down, or make an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Agility} roll to land safely. Within is more dead sea, mostly smaller fish, although there’s one struggling sea turtle. A few crabs crawl here and there when light is shone upon them. Up near the prow is a metal door with a complex lock.</p>\n<p>The characters hear the clatter of a large thing on the other side of the door, clumping around on the deck planks. It sounds like nothing they’ve ever heard before—unless they’ve ever seen an eight-legged horse with a limp ridden by someone playing castanets.</p>\n<h3>The Vault</h3>\n<p>There are three ways into the vault.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On the starboard side of the ship, opposite the character’s vessel, is a man-sized gash that opens up to the chamber. The characters had a chance to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} this if they inspected the ship before boarding.</li>\n<li>The wood on either side of the door can be chopped through fairly easily (Toughness 8). Being at the bottom of the ocean has softened it.</li>\n<li>The lock can be picked, although this isn’t easy. In addition to having multiple tumblers it’s also rusty. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} attempts are made at −6.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the characters can see inside, they spy dozens of large chests and cabinets and dressers lashed to the walls or lying on the deck. Their ruined contents lie strewn upon the planking. Perhaps those rotting clumps used to be silken finery or draperies or bedroom linens.</p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>Your attention is held by the clacking monstrosity that looms out of the darkness, a monstrous crab that stands half again as tall as a man. It scuttles toward you, reaching with both its claws.</p>\n</aside>\n<ul>\n<li>Giant Crab (1)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the giant crab is defeated the treasure can be examined. The cases were once enormously expensive wood carvings, gilt with gold and silver, but they’re quite ruined. So are all the furniture and a fortune in what probably was clothing and linens.</p>\n<p>However, one chest contains gold gilt dinnerware and another, smaller chest holds fine jewelry. A third thick wooden chest is covered with detailed symbols. Anyone with @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Arcana]{Arcana} can, with a successful roll, recognize these symbols as magical sigils, and tell that the rot and wet has eaten through the sigils so they’re no longer effective. A raise on the roll enables a character to recognize those sigils for particularly potent warding spells.</p>\n<p>Breaking through this chest requires three @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} rolls to avoid three jabbing needles—which will frighten rather than harm, for the once deadly poison has been soaked up by the wood surrounding the needle. More observant characters can @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} by the state of the chest that it’s rotten and that it’s probably possible to pry, hack, or even kick it open.</p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>Inside on long rotted cloth is a very small chest that’s a work of art in itself, studded with rubies and sapphires. It has no obvious lock or hinges, and on closer examination you wonder if it’s no chest, but solid gold.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>It’s likely far more valuable as is than it would be melted down and pried apart. A successful @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge} (−1) roll determines it could fetch upward of 3,000 golden galifars or more.</p>\n<p>This is the death jewel, and it has nearly exhausted its sorcerous ability to keep the derelict afloat. Once it’s picked up, the ship begins to list. From below is a loud pop and the ship promptly sinks into the water. If the characters climbed down (or up, through the gash) a rope, they can reach the top deck in four rounds; the water reaches the weather deck in six rounds, and the ship is completely submerged in eight.</p>\n<p>This should be run as a dramatic task. With @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} being rolled to grab treasure. 4 successes on these need to be rolled before a character will peel themselves away from grabbing treasure. Those who succeed can support others to try and pull them away.</p>\n<p>It is difficult, if not impossible, to escape with the entirety of the treasure glimpsed in the vault. It requires two sailors to carry either chest at a slow walking pace owing to their weight, and with the ship taking on water most characters are liable to simply grab a few handfuls of gold or necklaces or a gem-studded goblet.</p>\n<p>Roll [[/r 2d6]] for every character to determine the overall worth of whatever they managed to lay hands on, then multiply by 300. The result is the value of the object in rilks. Don’t skimp on the description. For instance: A diamond ring patterned with fish scales, an emerald studded goblet, a gold chalice, a gold dinner plate with the Overlord’s family crest stamped along the rim, a pearl necklace, a slim gold chain hung with a gleaming ruby, a tarnished beaker gilt with exquisite gold leaf showing swimming mermaids, etc.</p>\n<p>One of the characters should acquire a sapphire ring, the shanks of which are decorated with the image of a tower shield. It has been specially crafted to shield its wearer from mental assaults of the creature.</p>\n<h2>The Log Book</h2>\n<p>Extremely careful examination of the log book enables those reading it to get to the material in the middle. The opening pages and the blank back pages are too sodden to pry apart. Ideally, the characters should discover the information at the log book as the death jewel’s plans get underway—perhaps they feel the ship lurching under their feet as the controlled crew alters the vessel’s course.</p>\n<p>Most of the journal entries are mundane discussions of weather, but the captain writes occasional cryptic references about the cargo and how he was told he should clear away from the city if he valued his own safety. He seems fond of the Overlord’s daughter and asked her if she were in any danger, and she reported to him that all would be well so long as she wore the sapphire ring.</p>\n<p>The last entry reads almost like a confessional. The captain spent a heady night with the Overlord’s daughter and she told him the entire plot—how the entity controlled the minds of men, how the Overlord intended it to wreak havoc upon the aristocracy of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath}, and how she promised to make him her consort once she ruled the city. She also made mention of the ring’s power.</p>\n<h2>The Creature Moves</h2>\n<p>Once it’s safely aboard the heroes’ ship and attention is diverted from it, the creature’s gemstones clear and it begins to work its will. It means to return to Cyre as swiftly as possible and lay its eggs within the Overlord. It has little conception of or interest in the lifespan of humanity and is perfectly happy to take its vengeance upon the dead Overlord’s descendants.</p>\n<p>It’s first concern is to be free, having developed a strong distaste for enclosed spaces after long years, so it controls the nearest human and has it carry it about so it can see what’s happening. It does not like being stored in a chest or other container and definitely prefers to be carted around in someone’s arms.</p>\n<p>If there are Extras aboard the death jewel immediately sets them to raising full sails and altering course. It can control up to two dozen characters at a time, although owing to their sapped will and delayed movement any skill or attribute checks function at −4. Extras are assumed to fail.</p>\n<p>Characters can resist the creature’s control by making a successful @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Spirit} roll once per day. Unless they’re aware of the creature, they are unlikely to know what’s going on, and may assume that they’ve simply had a mild dizzy spell. The death jewel can control someone within 100 feet, even outside of sight range.</p>\n<p>Once ensorcelled, characters can attempt to break free of its spell with another @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Spirit} roll if they have harmed someone they care about or are actively engaged in something suicidal, or if the creature itself has taken damage.</p>\n<p>The entity communicates only through the humans it controls and doesn’t articulate well. If questioned or challenged, the humans only say things like the following, which sound very strange coming from the lips of friend and colleagues.</p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“You will never imprison me again! Cyre will pay, and my younglings will be birthed from the Overlord’s flesh!”</p>\n<p>“The Overlord meant to send me away, but I will have my vengeance!”</p>\n<p>“You humans are nothing but cattle. I shall steer you all and my children shall feed upon you.”</p>\n</aside>\n<p>It is rather blunt in its machinations, and attempts to kill those it cannot control. It tries to use those it can to protect itself. Those who resist the creature face a greater challenge in avoiding hurting their friends and allies than actually killing the terrible thing.</p>\n<h2>Aftermath</h2>\n<p>Once the creature is killed, all affected characters recover their own will. Those who were controlled by the creature only have a hazy, dream-like memory of actions they performed under its power.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_slwk1t4xhcl","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Savage Tales","color":"#000000"}}}

The last thing you remember is a blow to the back of your head and the waves ruching up to meet you.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">A hero in cramped quarters:</span>  You were between ships in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport}, and after stopping for a drink at a tavern called @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Salty Dog and The Baron]{the Salty Dog and The Baron}, you happened upon a damsel in distress in the alleyway outside. Thinking you could help, you didn’t notice the thugs hiding nearby, and they caught you unawares. You’ve been on enough ships to know a press gang by the blow of the sap on the back of your neck. You just hope whatever ship you end up on has a respectable captain.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Wasted plunder:</span>  You found yourself relatively well off when you got your share of your last voyage’s plunder, and decided to spend a few of your hard-won coins at @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Salty Dog and The Baron]{the Salty Dog and The Baron}, a popular sailor tavern in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport}.

Boisterious, lively, folk of the sea, a little bit shady, and you have always loved the cats there. Last night was another lively night. After a few drinks last night, you found yourself uncharacteristically joining into a brawl that started. Though you handled yourself well and just defending your new life long friend's honor. As you staggered around the corner to relieve yourself, you were set upon by a group of rough-looking thugs. They overwhlemed you and knocked you unconscious. At least you hope you did soil your pants.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Arawai's Blessing:</span>  You came to a tavern in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport} called @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Salty Dog and The Baron]{the Salty Dog and The Baron} in search of your fate or maybe just another ship to join. You’re not sure how many drinks you had, but they quickly went to your head and you passed out on the table before you found your destiny—unless it lay in the bottom of a bottle. Then again, maybe you found your destiny after all...</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Barron Tailspinner:</span>  You went to a tavern called @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Salty Dog and The Baron]{the Salty Dog and The Baron} in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport} to earn a few coins with your tales of the sea. The patrons seemed pleased with your performance and bought you a few drinks. You had just remembered a tale of an unfortunate sailor who found himself press-ganged on a pirate ship after his drink was drugged when suddenly everything went black.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Cabin Fever:</span> It took you a few months to sail here from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} aboard the <em>Tiger Princess</em>. That was way too long to be at sea without any stops. You arrived here in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport} almost a week ago, and you are finally starting to feel like you have made up for the time lost on the <em>Tiger Princess</em>. One more night at a new spot wouldn't hurt. You heard numerous good rumors about the ale and games at the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Salty Dog and The Baron]{the Salty Dog and The Baron}, and so it was time to check it out. You promised yourself this night you would only have one drink and have your wits about you to finally remeber what you can learn about what is happening in this city. You don't remember anything after that first drink.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":4},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_sfbrzx24rkb","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Player Character Guide","color":"#000000"}}}
{"_id":"276jgwCRrWKYcf0I","name":"04 Skeleton Crew","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Skeleton Crew</h1>\n<p>At dawn, a few hours after the celebration finally winds down, the ship’s bell sounds, calling all hands on deck. When the crew is assembled, a long line of captured officers and sailors from the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> is brought on deck and paraded before the crew. Prince Rockface addresses the captives first, offering a place on the <em>Storm Reaver's</em> crew for any who want to throw their lot in with pirates. Several of the Rahadoumi sailors step forward; Master Scourge cuts their bonds, and the sailors take their places among the <em>Storm Reaver's</em> crew. Prince Rockface then turns to address the <em>Storm Reaver's</em> crew.</p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“All right, you scurvy tars! You’ve done a right good job by me—we’ve got a second ship now, and she’s quite a prize from the looks of her. But I still have only one crew. So here’s the plan—the <em>Storm Reaver</em> will sail on to our planned destination with our new shipmates here, while Mister Lagraa will pick a skeleton crew to sail the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> to Port Krez, where she’ll be worth a pretty penny as salvage.</p>\n<p>“As for these fine fellows here”—Prince Rockface gestures at the remainder of the captured ship’s crew—“some of them will no doubt be worth a hefty ransom from their families back in Breland. And for the rest, if the life of a pirate’s not for them, they can spend the rest of their lives at sea!”</p>\n</aside>\n<p>To make her point, Prince Rockface grabs one of the Brelish sailors and throws her overboard to the accompaniment of cheers and laughter from the <em>Storm Reaver's</em> crew. As the unfortunate woman sinks beneath the waves, many of the remaining sailors scramble to swear their loyalty to Prince Rockface. The officers are led belowdecks and the crew begins to disperse to their daily tasks.</p>\n<p>As they do, Mister Lagraa and Master Scourge pick out several of the <em>Storm Reaver's</em> original crew, telling them to be aboard the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> within 10 minutes to set sail for Port Krez. The swabs are chosen to join the skeleton crew as well, and Scourge smiles evilly at them as he picks them. The swabs have little time left on the <em>Storm Reaver</em>, but allow them to gather whatever gear or loot they may have acquired, and give them one last chance to purchase supplies from the quartermaster’s store. If any of the swabs have befriended Cut-Throat Grok, she cries as they leave. If she was made helpful, she gives them a gift worth 100 gp from the stores on parting.</p>\n<p>The skeleton crew of the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mister Lagraa (now Captain)</li>\n<li>Master Scourage (now First Mate)</li>\n<li>Patch \"Salty\" Kolkrinun</li>\n<li>Krornik \"Fishguts\" Kragshard</li>\n<li>Owlbear Hartshorn</li>\n<li>The rest of the original crew of the <em>Storm Reaver</em>.</li>\n<li>The swabs</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New Ship, Harsher Discipline</h2>\n<p>As the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> sets sail, acting captain Mister Lagraa and her first mate Master Scourge gather the crew together to inform them that although this is a new ship, the rules are the same, though discipline on the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> will be a good deal harsher than on the lackadaisical <em>Storm Reaver</em>— all crimes are now punishable with the cat instead of the whip. All of the crew keep the same jobs they had before on the <em>Storm Reaver</em>, but they will have to work a good deal harder, as the crew is smaller.</p>\n<p><strong>Fatigue: </strong>From now on all checks to avoid @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} on the ship are made at a -2 penalty. Tasks that did not have a Vigor check for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}, now require a Vigor check.</p>\n<p>Master Scourge ensures that the swabs continue to have the worst jobs of the crew for the remainder of this journey (you should assign the swabs the worst duties or the duties they most hate every day rather than rolling randomly). As night falls, the sails of the <em>Storm Reaver</em> disappear over the horizon. Mister Lagraa does not believe in crew entertainment or rum rations, and anyone caught above decks after dusk without leave gets six lashes with the cat. At your discretion, gambling might still go on belowdecks, but it is quite likely that Mister Lagraa and Scourge will hear about it and act accordingly.</p>\n<h3>New Destination</h3>\n<p>That night, Mister Lagraa, Scourge, and those pirates loyal to them hold a secret meeting in the captain’s cabin, where they plot to sail the ship not to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Port Krez]{Port Krez}, but to a dry dock in Cliff's End called @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Rickety's Squibs]{Rickety's Squibs}, where they can make the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> their own and engage in piracy for themselves. Mister Lagraa and Scourge want only the most loyal crew with them, however, and plan to do away with the swabs and their friends as soon as Rickety’s Squibs is in sight. </p>\n<p>Friendly crew members begin whispering their concerns to the swabs by the second day of the voyage. If the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> is sailing back to Port Krez, what is to become of the group of press-ganged crew? Rumors begin to spread among the friendly crew members that Mister Lagraa might decide to claim the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> for himself and establish himself as a pirate captain in his own right. These rumors become more certain when a friendly cremember deduces (if the swabs haven’t already) that the ship has changed course and is heading west past @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Tidewater Rock]{Tidewater Rock} and into Cliff's End. If the swabs have not considered staging a mutiny themselves, friendly crewmembers begin making that suggestion for them, but only when the time is right. </p>\n<p>During the evening, Kragshard suggests to the swabs that he knows where the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> might be heading—to a seedy, isolated dry dock in Cliff's End called @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Rickety's Squibs]{Rickety's Squibs}. For a price, old Rickety Hake completely refits ships into “squibs,” providing new identities by changing ships’ lines, silhouettes, and general appearance to be unrecognizable to their former owners or anyone else familiar with them.</p>\n<h2>New Destination and Another Storm</h2>\n<p>Within a day or so the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> will clearly start heading south west instead of west. As it nears @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Tidewater Rock]{Tidewater Rock} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Traglorn Island]{Traglorn Island} a storm will hit the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> in the early hours of the morning. The <em>Majestic Griffon</em> is blown way off course and all hands are call to work on the deck. All hands are required to work in the rigging, given random @Compendium[savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-tables.Rigging Tasks}]{Rigging Tasks}. </p>\n<p>As the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> struggles off course, a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} check at –2 for swabs to see the dark shapes loom out of the sea all around the ship. Small islets and coral reefs that dot this area. The storm is fierce being the equivelant of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Illumination]{Dark illumination}.</p>\n<p>At this point a few grindylows will board the ship and make off with a couple of tasty sailors, Sandara Quinn among them. Emboldened by their success more grindylows attack the beleaguered ship for more food. They flee when half or more of them have been slain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Grindylow]{Grindylow} (6)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Shipwrecked</h2>\n<p>As the storm begins to abate, the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> hits the coral reefs surrounding @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Bonewreck Isle]{Bonewreck Isle} and runs aground. As the sun rises and the tide goes out, the members of the crew slowly come to terms with their predicament. The <em>Majestic Griffon</em> is holed in the main hold. A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Boating]{Boating} or @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Repair]{Repair} check is enough to surmise that although the ship is not in immediate danger of sinking, she’ll eventually sink unless repairs are made. Mister Lagraa immediately instructs several of the crew to begin dismantling the ship’s deck to repair the vessel.</p>\n<p>Early in the morning, Mister Lagraa calls the roll of the crew, and two of the ship’s sailors are discovered to be missing. One of the missing crew members is Sandara Quinn; the other should be chosen randomly from among those pirates most friendly to the swabs. Mister Lagraa is dismissive of the two pirates’ fate.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the crew discovers that the ship’s water barrel burst when the vessel ran aground and is now empty. Mister Lagraa orders the swabs to take one of the ship’s cutters and a couple of empty barrels and find fresh water and supplies on the nearby island. She tells the swabs that the ship will depart when repairs are done, whether they are back or not.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"quick-encounters":{"quickEncounter":"{\"journalEntryId\":\"MMMTZcygBDdHuIMw\",\"extractedActors\":[{\"numActors\":1,\"dataPackName\":\"savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-bestiary\",\"actorID\":\"KEeR7YOKnWikm2I1\",\"name\":\" Krornik Kragshard\",\"savedTokensData\":[],\"generatedTokensData\":[{\"actorId\":\"KEeR7YOKnWikm2I1\",\"isSavedToken\":false}],\"combinedTokensData\":[{\"actorId\":\"KEeR7YOKnWikm2I1\",\"isSavedToken\":false}]}],\"hideQE\":true,\"qeVersion\":\"0.8.4\"}"},"cf":{"id":"temp_n10pg472em","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Season 1: Mutiny Against the Cloudreavers","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"A2ermHLB3XPB2Tgq","name":"The Curse of Redbeard Rufus","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">The Curse of Redbeard Rufus</h1>\n<p>The group should be Heroic rank before running this adventure, and must have all six golden triangles to complete the quest.</p>\n<p>The island detailed on Winston’s map measures two miles by three and is covered in a morass of rotting vegetation with only a single clearing. Within the clearing stands a tall stone pedestal with six triangular indentations on the sides. Each golden triangle the group possesses fits perfectly into one of the indentations.</p>\n<p>Once all six pieces are placed in the depressions the stone splits apart revealing a shaft leading into the bowels of the island. The shaft is 30 feet deep. Unless the characters have brought rope there is no easy way down. Clambering down the slick sides requires a Climbing (–4) roll. Failure leads to a fall of 1d6+3 yards.</p>\n<p>At the bottom is a low tunnel leading into darkness. Anyone wishing to explore further must crawl on their hands and knees. Redbeard installed three traps to deter would be thieves.</p>\n<p><strong>Shallow Spiked Pit:</strong> Roughly 20 feet into the tunnel is a shallow pit filled with spikes and covered with thin planks of wood and a layer of loose earth. Detecting it requires a Notice (–2) roll. With a failure the lead character plunges headfirst into the pit suffering 2d6 damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Guillotine: </strong>Ten feet further in is a guillotine trap. A heavy blade has been attached to a pressure plate. The plate can be detected on a successful Notice (–2) roll. Failure results in 2d6 damage from the heavy blade.</p>\n<p><strong>Fire Pit:</strong> Lastly, Redbeard installed a trap using his trademark weapon—fire. Hidden in the floor is a pit filled with oil. A character failing to detect the trap—requiring a Notice (–2) roll—falls into the pit. Activating the trap triggers a flint and steel hidden in the ceiling. They light a tar-soaked torch, which drops into the pit, setting light to the oil and inflicting 2d10 damage per round to the unfortunate victim.</p>\n<p>Having survived the traps, the characters emerge into a wide chamber stacked high with gold and silver coins, jewelry, and gems. So much treasure—six King’s Ransoms—it fills an entire cargo space on their ship.</p>\n<h2>Old Friends</h2>\n<p>As soon as the group has finished bringing the first treasure to the surface a familiar gruff voice calls out from the nearby trees. “I see you lads have found what is rightfully mine.” Emerging from the vegetation are Abdullah (from Gallow’s Humor, above) and several of his crew—including his officers if they survived the first encounter. (If Abdullah didn’t survive, one of his lieutenants has taken his place.)</p>\n<p>Abdullah had visited the island before but lacked the golden triangles. Sensing the characters were the key to his problem, he raced for the island and lay in wait. Abdullah and his band hid on the island until they spotted the group’s ship—his ship lies outside the Flotsam Sea and visits every few days to drop off supplies. It is due back in two days.</p>\n<p>This is a fight to the death with Captains Abdullah and any survivors from among Rene the Blade, “Longarm” Hunk, and two additional pirates per hero.</p>\n<h2>Redbeard’s Treasure</h2>\n<p>Once Redbeard’s treasure is brought up from the earth, the Incinerator appears offshore. A minute later, Redbeard and his unearthly crew walk up out of the water and onto the beach.</p>\n<p>While the bulk of the treasure is above the earth, Redbeard is vulnerable. He must fight until either he is slain—permanently this time—or returns the treasure to its pit. Then the triangles fade from reality and reappear scattered around Caribdus by the whims of fate—with Redbeard cursed to seek them once again.</p>\n<h2>Redbeard Rufus</h2>\n<p>This is Redbeard in the undead state he’s in when he materializes near his treasure. On the high seas away from the island he is a ghost with the immaterial Special Ability instead. He doesn’t leave his ship in that state, however, so unless a foolhardy crew boards the Incinerator he should only be encountered in undead form.</p>\n<p>Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6, Spirit d8, Strength d8, Vigor d10 S k i l l s : B o a t i n g d 8 , Climbing d8, Fighting d10, Gambling d8, Intimidation d10, Notice d6, Shooting d8, Stealth d8, Streetwise d6, Swimming d6, Taunt d8, Throwing d8 Charisma: –6, Pace: 6; Parry: 7; Toughness: 12 Hindrances: Bloodthirsty, Mean, Vengeful E d g e s : R e a l l y D i r t y Fighting, First Strike, Improved Close Fighting, Quick, Quick Draw, TwoFisted Booty: Redbeard’s gear (below).

Redbeard was one of the first visitors to Caribdus, arriving not long after the Flood. The natives hadn’t encountered many pirates before and Redbeard amassed a fortune in treasure before a Kieran fleet sank his ship. Before he died, Redbeard made a vow never to rest in peace until his treasure was returned to him.</p>\n<p>“I worked for a captain by the name of Abdullah, a cruel Barbary pirate. After he had me flogged for somethin’ I don’t even remember, I jumped ship. But not before I stole this map and triangle. I think they’re related somehow.

Get ‘em, lads!” The owner of the voice is Captain Abdullah, Winston’s former captain. With him are his two officers and a gang of pirates. Abdullah may be a vicious murderer but he’s no fool—if he or any of his officers take two wounds they flee, leaving their men to cover their retreat. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Pirates (2 per Hero):</span> p. 195.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Captain Abdullah</h2>\n<p>Abdullah served as a Barbary pirate before arriving in Caribdus.

When the ships were scattered, Rene’s captain fled north where his ship was caught in a violent storm and brought to Caribdus. Rene’s small frame belies his hunter’s instincts and skill with knives.

{"_id":"BIeSA05DkU7BT5N1","name":"Sandara Quinn","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<p>Life is never easy, and Sandara Quinn’s life has been typical of that truism. The daughter of a poor fisherman and a seamstress, Sandara was raised in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]. Her overworked parents had little time to spend with their daughter, and Sandara grew up on the port’s hard streets, where she quickly learned to look after herself. She worked on the docks when she could, carrying out what jobs she could get, and soon developed a keen eye for trouble and a reputation for standing up for herself. She began frequenting the bars and taverns of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport] by the age of 9 and was learning the ropes of sailing by the age of 12.</p>\n<p>Sandara’s calling came one night when a fleet of fishermen, which included her father, was lost in a powerful storm. Sandara prayed to Arawai, and when her father returned the following day, weatherbeaten and half-drowned but still alive, Sandara knew the goddess had answered her prayers. Soon after, Sandara began devoting her time to the worship of Arawai, eventually setting up a small chapel on the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport] docks dedicated to her.</p>\n<p>Just 3 weeks ago, Sandara’s beloved father died, and she took to the sea, determined to live her life to the hilt, not rot away in some forgotten port. She only made it as far as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport], however, before she fell afoul of Prince Rockface’s press gang and ended up aboard the <em>Storm Reaver</em>. There are worse places to be than a pirate ship, however, and Sandara has taken to her new surroundings like a fish returned to the sea from which it was born. She still bears the raw scars of grief from burying her father, but knows enough to mask that grief on a vessel such as the <em>Storm Reaver</em>. Sandara plans to make the most of her present situation, intending to spread the word of her goddess while expanding her horizons at the same time.</p>\n<p>The night before the adventure starts, Master Scourge made a pass at Sandara, and she responded by slapping the boatswain and making it clear that she finds him repulsive.

{"_id":"CmVgjUujd79dDOpg","name":"Dead Men Tell No Tales","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Dead Men Tell No Tales</h1>\n<h3>The Soul Survivor</h3>\n<p>About a day out of Nevis, aboard the Sloop Lady Faire, the lookout spots a small dingy adrift. The wood of the hull is rotting and pitted, the metal jigs and oar hooks, rusted. The only occupant is a haggard, half dead sailor. His face gaunt and yellow, eyes sunk deep in his head. His clothing is half rotted, tattered, and torn. Oddly his hands and feet are manacled. A small metal chest is secured by a chain to his foot manacle.</p>\n<p>“Me mates…is dead,” the man says. “I bringed trouble…to the ship... an’ the Cap’n set me adrift.” The sailor coughs, blood foaming out his mouth. “There be plunder…aplenty… finish what ye start.” Another cough, “Beware…the cur…” With a final cough the sailor keels over and dies.</p>\n<h3>15 Men on a Dead Man’s Chest</h3>\n<p>The iron chest is bound with steel. It’s encrusted with barnacles and rust. The rot around the hinges and lock have been cleared. A clear crack between lid and case indicate the chest has been opened.</p>\n<p>Little does the crew know they have already begun the curse simply by bringing the chest aboard the Lady Faire.</p>\n<p>Inside rests a rolled up leather parchment. The cracked ivory scroll caps are yellow with age. A new leather tie secures the scroll. Unrolled, a map identifies an island four days sail west of Saint Kitts.</p>\n<h3>Ghost Ship</h3>\n<p>If the crew pursues the treasure, the lookout spots a two-masted sloop on the second day. The sails are tattered, one mast broken two thirds the way to the top. The cannon covers are gone or hanging, hinges busted. It lists hard to port. From the aft deck hangs the Jolly Roger.</p>\n<p>As they approach, they see no movement on deck. Several bodies are visible. The helmsman is slumped across the wheel. A lookout is hanging from the rigging, his leg caught in the lines. Several more bodies lie on the deck. It is unclear what happened as no sign of battle damage is seen.</p>\n<p>If they board the pirate sloop, the heroes are met by a grisly scene. The crewmen are rotting, their insides spilling on the deck through cracked ribs and yellowed parchment flesh. Feasting rats scurry away as the crew boards. The scene is such the crew must make a Guts check suffer a –1 penalty to all trait rolls while aboard.</p>\n<h3>Stowaway</h3>\n<p>As the crew explores the upper deck have them make a Notice roll (–1). Below deck the penalty is –2, due to the lack of light. With a success they spot a translucent figure watching them from across the deck. The ghostly apparition appears as a young lady, dressed in a style of clothing from half a century ago. As the crew member looks at her she fades away, leaving a gentle smile and tiniest of nods. On a 1 (regardless of the result of the Wild Die), the spirit fades from the beautiful young lady, into a decayed, tattered, corpse. The departing smile is accompanied by a flash of red eyes. (Each crew member sees her just once. )</p>\n<h3>The Captain</h3>\n<p>Nothing of value exists aboard, all having decayed, rotted or corroded. As they reach the last place oin the ship to be searched, they encounter the ship’s Captain. More walking dead than living human and completely insane, he immediately attacks. Check for surprise normally.</p>\n<h3>X Marks the Spot</h3>\n<p>As the crew leaves the doomed vessel, dark clouds have rolled in and the seas have begun to swell. For two days the storm continues, with rough seas and low clouds. The crew notices several ropes have begun to rot, canvas to stiffen and crack, and they too start to age visibly.</p>\n<p>On the fourth day of the journey the storm breaks and an island is visible on the horizon, home to a ragged dock, and the remains of a small fishing village.</p>\n<p>All around are the skeletal remains of the villagers, long dead. A tall steeple church with a cemetery lies at the far end of the village. The map leads the crew past the church to the gated entrance of a mine. Breaking through the gate the entrance tunnel leads down to a cavern. Half-way along, several skeletons have been draped with the Jolly Roger.</p>\n<p>In the cavern are several chests surrounded with gold and silver treasure. Hanging by the neck over the chest is a decayed corpse—the physical body of the young woman on the doomed ship.</p>\n<h3>The Curse</h3>\n<p>As the crew examines the cavern the pirate skeletons animate and attack. Even if they are destroyed, they reform an hour later. The crew and the Lady Faire continue to rot away whether they leave with any treasure or not. There is only one way to free themselves of the curse.</p>\n<p>The young woman must be cut down and buried in holy ground. If this is done, the curse is gone and its effect reverse. It does not bring back those who have died or return the pirate ship, however. The rotting hulk is beyond repair and the heroes may need to replenish their crew. But that is another adventure.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_slwk1t4xhcl","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Savage Tales","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"IkZjjtm38IiDL0Ld","name":"The Bounty of Black Skull","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">The Bounty of Black Skull</h1>\n<p>The heroes are hired by the Thieves’ Guild to collect their take, but tracking down the notorious Captain Black Skull proves more difficult than at first glance.</p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>With all the thievery and criminal acts running rampant in the City of Sevenscore Thousand Smokes, there’s always a need to bring these vile thieves to justice. Bounty hunting is a lucrative trade in Lankhmar. It takes a quick recovery and a whole lot of courage to boot, as this profession is extremely dangerous.</p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>The Thieves’ Guild has put a bounty on the notorious head of Captain Black Skull, a frightening and dastardly rogue of a pirate who docks from time to time in Lankhmar for supplies. Black Skull is accused of cheating the Thieves’ Guild out of a substantial amount of loot in a highstakes game of One Eyed Death, escaping in the end unscathed.</p>\n<p>Everyone on the docks knows Captain Black Skull as a power-hungry ogre of a man whose temper gets the best of him, especially after drinking pitchers of ale at the gambling table. What they don’t know, is the real Captain Black Skull is the finely attractive woman and devious first mate Marran. Being a female captain doesn’t bestow the level of respect and prestige most male captains enjoy. Marran compensates for this fact by switching places with her first mate Boulo, who dresses up and plays the part of Captain Black Skull while in port. While out at sea, Marran, the true Captain Black Skull, rules with an iron fist.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>The one unique characteristic or distinction the infamous Captain Black Skull possesses is a dark birthmark in the shape of a skull and bones. Marran bears this mark on the palm of her right hand. She hides this detail by wearing a pair of leather gloves which she says aids in reducing rope burns while at sea. Boulo has a replica birthmark firmly marked with black dye on his forearm for all to see, thus completing the guise and her ruse while in port.</p>\n<p>Boulo is accustomed to all the power which comes with being captain and plans to mutiny against Marran after resupplying in Lankhmar. After making berth in Lankhmar’s docks and Boulo’s leave of the ship to keep up appearances, one of Marran’s crew breaks down and informs her of Boulo’s mutinous intent. Infuriated by the news, she vows to get her revenge. If Boulo wants to be a captain, then a captain he shall be, and the best part is she doesn’t have to do any of the dirty work.</p>\n<h2>HELPING HANDS</h2>\n<p>The heroes are summoned to the Thieves’ Guild in the northern Tenderloin District of Lankhmar in the late evening hours. Read the following as one of its members introduces himself and conveys the purpose of their summons to the guild. “The Thieves’ Guild has a proposition I know you‘ll not pass up the chance to fulfill. We require your services in locating and bringing back here before us, the notorious Captain Black Skull who has stolen a large sum of money from our house. We wish to squeeze the very life from his body as penance for his cheating ways from our last meeting. We’ve heard tales his ship made port this very morn in the city docks.</p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">“Be forewarned. Not much is known of him, but our sources say he prides himself on terrorizing others with his stout stature, all the while leaving gambling and drinking debts in his wake. He bears a darkened birthmark in the shape of a skull and bones, hence his namesake. Bring him preferably back alive, but under no certain circumstance should you return without his scraggly thieving carcass. Your payment is 100 gold rilks each. Do not let us down.“</aside>\n<p>The guild member ends the meeting and bids them farewell. On a successful Common Knowledge roll at −2, the heroes recall having heard the name of Captain Black Skull from various rumors and stories. All tales seem to end in describing his ruthlessness and cruelty as a professional pirate.</p>\n<p>With a successful Streetwise roll, the newly employed bounty hunters learn Captain Black Skull usually wanders the various taverns and gambling houses in Lankhmar before settling in one for the night to drink his fill and gamble the night away. It takes 2d4 hours of randomly searching the streets of Lankhmar to come upon news of his whereabouts somewhere on the docks. With a raise, they catch wind he may be at the Pixie Leg Tavern at the north end of the docks and may immediately proceed there.</p>\n<h2>THE PIXIE LEG TAVERN</h2>\n<p>The heroes traverse their way through the smoke-flooded streets of Lankhmar to the Pixie Leg Tavern located on the north end of the dock region. All manner of seafaring folk are pushing and shoving their way around like a school of fish. Entering the not-so-clean establishment, the heroes see several tables filled with Lankhmar’s finest sea urchins and a long wooden bar which looks as if it were made from the hull of a shipwreck. A salty, seaworthy barkeep eyes them over and tells them to sit wherever they like.</p>\n<p>Looking around the tavern at the many different people and wrinkled faces, no amount of searching for Captain Black Skull provides any leads. If the heroes inquire about him, no one coughs up any information to his whereabouts. Just before the characters are about to leave, Marran glances at them from one of the far corner tables and nods for them to come sit with her. Read the following as the heroes engage in conversation with Marran.</p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“I hear ye be looking for that tyrant of a sea dog Captain Black Skull. Oh what I wouldn’t do to see him swinging from the gallows, every bit of life draining from his miserable wretched body. He’s done nothing but made us slaves to his power-hungry ambitions and gambling afflictions. We’ve hardly eaten anything not spoiled in days.</p>\n<p>“My name is Marran. I am first mate to that loathsome ale-sucking creature. He stuffs his face while we, his loyal crew, scratch for the crumbs from his plate and nearly starve. I know exactly where he’ll be this night, drinking away our hard earned profits while sitting about a gambling table like the ruler of all the seas.</p>\n<p>“I’ll make a deal with ye. I’ll tell ye where ye and your bounty hunting friends can find that worthless dog if ye do a favor for the crew and me. Do we have an accord?”</p>\n</aside>\n<p>Marran lays out her terms to the heroes. She wants them to break into Gabhlens Fine Foods, a high-priced upscale storehouse located on Cheap Street. Gabhlens Fine Foods buys and sells some of the finest foods in Lankhmar. She tells them she and the crew only want to eat and why not eat from those what can spare it. Marran lays out a list of items she wants the heroes to collect for her.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One basket of honey oat grain bread</li>\n<li>One barrel of Mitokin’s finest ale</li>\n<li>One cask of Red Rosa wine</li>\n<li>Half dozen live royal crested roasting hens</li>\n<li>One wheel of Strogenburgh goat cheese</li>\n<li>One bushel of Rupol Periwinkle apples</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only real treasure is the royal crested roasting hens. They are by far the rarest and most valuable of food commodities within the storehouse. Each hen can easily fetch 5 or more gold rilks apiece. The other items she requests are just there to make her request seem less suspicious. Marran conveys that upon receiving the food here in the back alley of the Pixie Leg Tavern, she’ll divulge the whereabouts of Captain Black Skull to them; otherwise they’ll probably never locate him in time before setting sail tomorrow morning. w Marran: See page 17.</p>\n<h2>SHOPPING SPREE</h2>\n<p>Arriving at Gabhlens Fine Foods, the heroes make their way to the back alley shipping door which is the best way into the storehouse without being seen. The door is locked. With a successful Lockpicking roll, the heroes gain entrance into the dark storehouse. A successful Notice roll reveals the sounds of heavy snoring from a sleeping guard some thirty feet away.</p>\n<p>The characters may try to collect the mundane items without waking the slumbering watchman. This requires a successful Stealth roll for each barrel, basket, cask, wheel, or bushel of food taken.</p>\n<p>Approaching the individually-caged royal crested roasting hens panics the birds to the point their cries wake the guard from his deep sleep. The guard stands his ground with only two intruders, but any more and he tries to parley with the heroes. He suggests they pay him 10 gold rilks for his silence towards the burglary along with a nice bump on the head to convince his employer of his heroic attempt in trying to thwart the thieves. With the guard in check, the heroes load their wares on a conveniently placed covered shipping cart and make their way back to the back alley of the Pixie Leg Tavern. • Storehouse Guard: See page 17.</p>\n<h2>A PROMISE FULFILLED</h2>\n<p>Living up to their end of the bargain, the heroes relinquish the cart full of food to Marran and her crew. Keeping her word, she tells the heroes Captain Black Skull is at the Crooked Dagger, a loathsome and treacherous gambling house located on Murder Alley and surprisingly close to the Thieves’ Guild.</p>\n<p>Marran thanks them for the food and wishes them good luck in capturing the old scallywag of a captain. She even conveys her delight in the possibility of using excessive force during the seizure, which brings a wry smile to her face.</p>\n<p>A storm begins to swell over the city as the characters make ready for the Crooked Dagger. Raindrops resonate off the various metals, woods, and stone slabs throughout the city. It’s very late at night when the heroes traverse through the dark and stormy streets to the gambling house.</p>\n<h2>DEALER'S CHOICE</h2>\n<p>Arriving at their final destination, the characters spy an old wooden door with a rusty and severely bent dagger hanging from a set of iron chains. A small slide door, used for viewing visitors, is notched into the top of the locked door. Making their presence known, the slide door quickly thrusts open to reveal a nasty looking eyeball seated next to a crimson-red eye patch, both above a long beaklike warty nose. The man asks the nature of this late night interruption.</p>\n<p>The doorman doesn’t let anyone in unless the characters either drop the name of or somehow associates themselves with Captain Black Skull or announce their intentions of spending an exuberant amount of money gambling the night away here at the Crooked Dagger.</p>\n<p>Read the following as the heroes finally gain passage into the decrepit looking old dwelling.</p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">Rats scurry about the floor. The smell of soot and filth linger in the air as the old man navigates you through a large gambling room filled with miscreants and thieves playing all manner of games. Knocking on the lone door of a private gambling chamber, the door creaks open to reveal several unsavory and vile men sitting around a heavy oaken table. Thick smoke from various smoking pipes billows and swirls above the table like a miniature city of Lankhmar itself. At the far end of the table sits a very robust and commanding looking man wearing a black captain’s hat. Ale drips from his food-speckled beard, almost splashing on his right forearm where a birthmark in the shape of a skull and bones resides. It doesn’t take long to determine you’ve finally found your prize in locating one Captain Black Skull.</aside>\n<p>The gamblers look over the heroes. Boulo, acting as Captain Black Skull, believes the characters to be ripe for the picking in swindling their money away. Not wanting to pass up the chance to line his pockets full of gold, especially when it’s at the expense of those less ruthless and cunning than he is, Boulo encourages the heroes to a friendly game of cards.</p>\n<p>If the characters participate, read the following as they are shown a chair around the large table and brought a draft of ale while Boulo lays out the terms of the card game, ending his speech with a hearty laugh.</p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">“Glad ye decided to join us. I be Captain Black Skull, scourge of the high seas, commander of the four winds, and ruler of all creatures beneath the deep. If ye seek fame and fortune, ye have certainly come to the right place tonight. “The game be one eyed death! With one hand shall the lowest player lose their coin and nothing more. If ye be at the bottom of the heap for a second go-round, ye not only loses ye loot, but we pops out one of ye pretty looking eyes as a prize. Oh, and we do have a fine selection of eye patches if ye be worried about looking proper while out in public.”</aside>\n<p>One Eyed Death uses the Gambling skill rules in Savage Worlds. The stakes for each half hour of gambling are decided by the winner of the previous round. Boulo sets the stakes for the first round at five gold rilks. Anyone not able to satisfy the current stakes amount must leave the game or be forcefully removed.</p>\n<p>Any player who rolls the lowest Gambling roll twice during the game not only pays the winner but is expected to let him remove an eye of his choice from the loser, in turn incurring the One Eye Hindrance. Boulo is a thieving cheat at heart and almost never plays fair. If caught cheating or after a couple of rounds of losing, Boulo accuses the winning hero of cheating and escalates words into a fight to the finish. If none in the group decides to participate in the game of One Eyed Death, Boulo grows angry by their intrusion and has them removed from the Crooked Dagger…which results in an all-out bar fight. w Boulo: See page 16. • Gamblers (1 per every 2 Heroes): See page 17.</p>\n<h2>SKULL AND DOUBLE CROSS BONES</h2>\n<p>The heroes finally capture Boulo and lead him outside to the Thieves’ Guild during the now-torrential rainstorm. They are met by a group of guild members who take Boulo into custody. As Boulo is being led away, just before the heroes are to receive their compensation, one of the escorts cries out he’s an impostor while pointing to Boulo’s now running and watery skull and bones birthmark due to the rain. Sending them away with no bounty, the Thieves’ Guild instructs the heroes to complete their job and bring back the real Captain Black Skull. The group is greeted by a courier outside the guild who delivers them a piece of parchment. Read the following as the heroes open the message to reveal the true magnitude and nature of their double cross.</p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>To ye renowned Lankhmar bounty hunters who have captured and brought that scallywag, loathsome, and mutinous seadog of a devil to justice, I, the true Captain Black Skull thank ye.</p>\n<p>The fraud who be rotting in the dungeon of the Thieves’ Guild this eve be a vile demon for sure as I truthfully spoke prior. A watery tear need not be shed over me mutinous first mate’s recent departure as his acts of betrayal and tyranny have finally come to an end. Twas his own hand what stole the money from the Guild, hoping to pin the deed upon me.</p>\n<p>Until our paths cross once again in the City of Sevenscore Thousand Smokes, I bid ye farewell. Oh, and me crew thanks ye for the delectable treats ye so graciously provided for our late night departure, especially the highly prized and expensive royal fowl. They ought to fetch a handsome sum. The message is signed “Captain Marran Black Skull.”</p>\n</aside>\n<p>Although Boulo is not the real Captain Black Skull, his debt to the Thieves’ Guild is real. If the heroes persuade their employer of this, they are paid grudgingly. The true name of Captain Black Skull, however, nets them an additional 20 gold rilks each.</p>\n<h2>HEROES AND VILLAINS</h2>\n<p>Boulo</p>\n<p>The first mate of Marran—the real Captain Black Skull—he’s a mighty robust and power hungry pirate. Playing the role of Captain Black Skull while in port, he’s grown accustomed to his role and plans to take it on permanently by mutinying against Marran.17 Attributes: @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Agility} d8, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Smarts} d6, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Spirit} d8, @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Strength} d8, Vigor d10 Skills: Boating d8, Fighting d8, Gambling d8, Intimidation d8, Notice d6, Streetwise d8 Cha: −2; Pace: 5; Parry: 6; Toughness: 9 (1) Hindrances: Greedy (Major), Mean, Obese Edges: Iron Jaw Gear: Cutlass (Str+d6), dagger (Str+d4), leather armor (+1).

The servants become quite insistent if the group refuses, saying their master has a most pressing matter he wishes to discuss with them.</p>\n<p>Racen greets his guests cordially and shows them into the dining room where a feast has been laid on. Once the servants have left the room Racen gets straight to business.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“My daughter, Rana, is something of a feisty child and has often spoken ill of the Emperor in public. Captain Livis, the new garrison commander, overheard her latest outburst and threatened to send her in chains to Kiera unless she married him. Of course she refused, but I had no choice but to protect her from Jant’s sadism, so I consented to the marriage.</p>\n<p>I tried to convince Livis to change his mind once he had cooled down but he refused. I admit my actions were foolish, but I cannot let my daughter marry him. I want you to kidnap my daughter from Livis’ quarters and take her to one of the Free Towns. Nowhere in Kiera will be safe for her after tonight. I have a small chest containing 8,000 pieces of eight for her to start a new life.</p>\n<p>“She must believe the kidnapping is real— tell her nothing of the truth until she is well away from here. In return I offer you a family heirloom.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>Racen pulls a rapier down from its wall mounting and hands it to the characters. The sword is called Mage Slayer and bypasses all forms of magical protection, including armor, barrier, and deflection spells.</p>\n<p>Livis’ quarters are adjacent to, but outside, the fort. Livis is spending the night in the fort but has posted 10 men to guard his rebellious bride, who is locked in the master bedroom. Any excessive noise during the rescue—such as gunshots, screams, or shouting—results in the alarm being raised. Captain Livis and twenty of his men come to investigate in 1d6+1 rounds. Livis executes any captured kidnappers out of hand.</p>\n<p>Rana is not privy to her father’s plan and believes the characters are pirates who intend to ravage and murder her. She does not listen to any attempt to explain the situation and tries to defend herself at every opportunity.</p>\n<p> Captain Livis (184): Wild Card Veteran City Watch.</p>\n<p> Soldiers (184): 10 City Watch.</p>\n<p>Rana Racen</p>\n<p>Rana is well-bred, well-educated, and extremely attractive—and she knows it.

{"_id":"MfxQEJpAFYnCf2JW","name":"Krornik \"Fishguts\" Kragshard","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<p>Most people think Krornik “Fishguts” Kragshard gets his nickname from the stains on his apron or the contents of his infamous stew, but few know he earned the sobriquet as a competitive eater in the low bars of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport}. As a young man, it was said that Kragshard could eat more of anything, and faster, than anyone. Folks still talk about the night that Kragshard devoured an entire bucket of boiled eggs in the Salty Swab by the docks.</p>\n<p>Kragshard was trained as a professional chef at the Lobster’s Armor, one of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport}’s most popular (and expensive) restaurants, but when he was thrown out for inappropriate behavior with his assistant, he ended up plying his trade with several sailing vessels in the Lhazaar before embarking on Captain Rockface’s <em>Storm Reaver</em>, where he has served as ship’s cook for the past 3 years.</p>\n<p>An affable fellow, Kragshard loves his food, and has more recently developed a taste for rum, a habit that’s only encouraged by Cut-Throat Grok, the <em>Storm Reaver's</em> quartermaster and Kragshard’s best friend aboard the ship.</p>\n<p>Sadly for Kragshard, his drinking led him to bet his own life against Prince Rockface in a card game one drunken night 2 years ago. Kragshard lost, and his life became Rockface’s to do with what he would. Rockface now thinks as little of Kragshard as he does a bilge rat, but he’s not yet killed the cook because drunk as he is, Kragshard is still a better cook than anyone else on the <em>Storm Reaver</em>, and the captain is partial to his cooking.</p>\n<p>Kragshard’s days begin with blearily handing out ship’s biscuits to the crew on deck before retiring to the galley to prepare the evening meal (almost always fish stew) in a big pot. Then he cozies up with a bottle of rum (sometimes mixed with raw eggs) and waits for the rest of the day to pass. Nevertheless, Kragshard is a skilled chef, though few of the crew beyond the captain and his officers ever get the chance to sample Kragshard’s more palatable fare.</p>\n<p>His only joy, aside from drinking and swapping yarns with Grok, are his chickens. Kragshard loves his poultry and collects any rare breeds he comes across. Anyone with a background in farming finds Kragshard friendly, while those who truly know their birds quickly discover a helpful friend. Kragshard’s favorite bird, a large black cockerel named Black-Hearted Bezebel, often perches on the cook’s shoulder and even talks to him, or so Kragshard occasionally drunkenly claims.</p>\n<h3>Appearance</h3>\n<p>Kragshard is a large, some would say fat, man, weighing well over 200 pounds and standing only 5 feet tall. He exudes an air of neglect, perhaps even despair, from the bushy tufts of black hair behind his ears, to his rotting teeth, to the stains on his filthy apron. He walks with a wallowing waddle, particularly when drunk, but is capable of surprising acts of strength. Kragshard talks with a thick Shackles accent, which some people find hard to follow. He’s had so many lashes that his back is like tanned leather, and he claims to not even feel the bite of the lash anymore. After 44 years in the school of hard knocks, Kragshard is a man who clearly cares little for himself or what people think of him. Nevertheless, he is at heart a kind man, and does his best to protect his cook’s mate from punishments brought on by mistakes made by either of them.</p>\n<h3>Gossip</h3>\n<p>The PCs can learn the following about Kragshard with successful Diplomacy checks to gather information.</p>\n<p>DC 5: “Fishguts” might once have been a famous chef at that fancy place in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport}, but now all he cooks is fishgut stew. He’s so pickled in rum now, bilgewater is all he can make.</p>\n<p>DC 10: Remember the last cook’s mate? Nobody does—only when he disappeared. Just up and vanished, that one, like he was spirited away, or maybe dropped in a pot...</p>\n<p>DC 15: Kragshard was so drunk once that he bet his life in a game with the captain, and now he’s little more than Rockface’s slave.</p>\n<h3>CampaiGn Role</h3>\n<p>Krornik Kragshard begins the adventure as a cynical, washed up drunk who is insensibly intoxicated half of the time, dreaming of a better life. However, he is also an obvious potential friend and ally of the PCs, as he loathes the captain and crew of the <em>Storm Reaver</em> and longs for a chance to escape. Kragshard makes an excellent NPC to plant the idea of mutiny in the PCs’ minds. He is not a risktaker, however, and can, like Sandara Quinn (see page 56), act as a voice of reason as the PCs plan their actions. If the PCs manage to befriend Kragshard, he can become a useful ally for the PCs in the future. Besides being a fine cook, he has handy communication skills and can also help out in a fight if needed. Kragshard has also plied his trade in the Shackles throughout his life and has an excellent knowledge of the region and its perils, personalities, and possibilities.</p>\n<p>As the adventure progresses, Kragshard’s interactions with the PCs begin to give his life purpose, to the extent that by the time the PCs move to the Man’s Promise in Part Two, he begins drinking much less. Away from the sour atmosphere of the <em>Storm Reaver</em>, Kragshard’s spirits lighten, and he is only drunk 1 day in every four. When the PCs finally mutiny, Kragshard is sober for the event, and aids the PCs as best he can. If the mutiny is successful, Kragshard announces that his new friends have inspired him to turn over a new leaf. If the PCs are cutthroats, Kragshard throws his lot in with them to begin a new life. If they are kindhearted dandies, Kragshard sees in them a more honorable way of life. Regardless, he offers his services as ship’s cook to the PCs. His lapses into drinking become less frequent—he is now drunk only 1 day in every week—and continue to be so throughout the rest of the Adventure Path.</p>\n<p>It is unlikely that the PCs will make an enemy of Kragshard, but should they do so, he gladly assists anyone who wants to kill the PCs. Having had a taste of possible freedom, he wants to punish those who let him taste it before he crawls back into the bottom of a rum bottle to die.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/characters/krornik-kragshard.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"person","_viewcount":3,"role":"","location":"Majestic Griffon","race":"Dwarf","gender":"Male","age":"178","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":"","profession":"Ship's Cook","voice":"","faction":"","height":"","weight":"","traits":"","ideals":"","bonds":"","flaws":"","longterm":"","shortterm":"","beliefs":"","secret":"","DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":{"notes":""},"scrollPos":"{\".tab.details .tab-inner\":0,\".tab.description .tab-inner\":0,\".relationships .items-list\":0}","relationships":[],"pronoun":"He/Him","_lasttab":"description","fields":{"race":{"value":true},"gender":{"value":true},"age":{"value":true},"eyes":{"value":true},"skin":{"value":false},"hair":{"value":true},"pronoun":{"value":true},"profession":{"value":true},"voice":{"value":true},"faction":{"value":false},"height":{"value":false},"weight":{"value":false},"traits":{"value":true},"ideals":{"value":false},"bonds":{"value":false},"flaws":{"value":true},"longterm":{"value":true},"shortterm":{"value":true},"beliefs":{"value":true},"secret":{"value":true}}},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_bgiu42x0xnj","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar Lore#/CF_SEP/Lhazaar Principalities#/CF_SEP/02.09.12.

They all remember the night before, but they all blacked out at some point. The pirates awake feeling groggy like they are still hung over. Before the pirates can do much more than sit up, Master Scourge enters the hold to wake them and get them up to the main deck. Six rough-looking <em>Storm Reaver</em> pirates, armed with saps, accompany him. An expression that might be mistaken for pain but which is clearly an attempt at a smile bruises Scourge's face as he cracks the whip in his hand and screams at newcomers.</p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“Still abed with the sun over the yardarm? On your feet, ye filthy swabs! Get up on deck and report for duty afore Prince Rockface flays your flesh into sausage skins and has Fishguts fry ye up for breakfast!”</p>\n</aside>\n<p>The pirates quickly discover that most, if not all, of their weapons and equipment are gone. If the any refuse, even momentarily, to accompany Scourge, he lashes out at any offender with his whip. If necessary, he calls for aid from his crew, who attack uncooperative characters with their saps. It should be immediately clear that if they don't cooperate, they will quickly be overpowered. </p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> If the pirates decide to fight, Master Scourge and his pirates attack subduing them. The <em>Storm Reaver</em> pirates will not the kill the new comers, however. Once they have the upper hand, they will take the offender—conscious or unconscious—to the main deck, where they get an immediate taste of @Compendium[savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-tales.Ship Punishments]{punishment} on the <em>Storm Reaver</em>. The offenders are tied to the mainmast, and Master Scourge gives each of them three lashes before the captain's address.</p>\n<p class=\"example\"><strong>Skill Check:</strong> On the way to the upper deck, have the pirates make notice checks. On a <strong>success </strong>they hear someone making oinking sounds and talking soothingly to was sounds like a pig. On a raise someon hears the rattle of a chain, and a slight whimper.</p>\n<h2>Meeting the Captain</h2>\n<p>Once on the main deck it's quickly apparent that they are on a sizable ship in the middle of the ocean, far from any land. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Greentarn]{Greentarn} are just an ochre haze many miles astern. Figures cluster around the ship's mainmast, looking up at the higher deck on the stern, where two figures stand, Prince Rockface and First Mate Mister Lagraa.</p>\n<p>There are three other recruits are standing with them on the deck, set apart by their relative cleanliness and their apparent unease with their newfound situation. The other three were picked up in Elysium, Sandara Quinn, Rosie Cusswell, and Conchobhar Turlach Dalian. A dozen or so other pirates stand about on the deck or in the ship's rigging. Once everyone is on the main deck, the captain speaks.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar read-aloud\">\n<p>“Glad you could join us at last! Welcome to the <em>Storm Reaver</em>! My thanks for ‘volunteering' to join my crew. I'm Mika Rockface. That's Prince Rockface to you filthy lot, not that you'll ever need to address me. I have only one rule—don't speak to me. I like talk, but I don't like your talk. Follow that rule and we'll all get along fine.</p>\n<p>“Oh, and one more thing. Even with you new recruits, we're still short-handed, and I aim to keep what crew I have. There'll be a keelhaulin' for anyone caught killin' anyone. Mr. Lagraa! If you'd be so kind as to make pirates out of these landlubbers, it'll save me having to put them in the sweatbox for a year and a day before I make pies out of 'em.”</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Job Assignments</h2>\n<p>After some recent difficulties, the <em>Storm Reaver </em>is undermanned and there are some roles that need to be filled. Mister Lagraa first is looking for a new rigger. The scoundrals are all required to climb to the crows nest.</p>\n<p class=\"example\"><strong>Dramatic Task</strong> This will require 3 round Dramtic Task. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} checks are the only skilled allowed. The pirate with the most success tokens is the winner is that they are now a rigger and work directly for Mister Lagraa. Anyone caught deliberately trying to fail the test will be immediately given three lashes as @Compendium[savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-tales.Ship Punishments]{punishment}.</p>\n<p>Lagraa's second test is one of necessity—he knows the ship's cook, Krornik “Fishguts” Kragshard, has a drinking problem, and he's fed up with eating rubbish. This test is simple: Lagraa asks each pirate in turn whether they can cook, and if one of them says yes, theybecoe the new cook's mate. If Lagraa gets to the end of the line without an affirmative answer, he simply picks the fattest pirate (Lagraa assumes that character likes food the most) and says, “You're a cook's mate now,” and tells that PC to report to Krornik Kragshard in the galley. If more than one person claims to be a good cook, Lagraa picks the fattest.</p>\n<p>The remaining pirates are all assigned to be swabs, under the command of Master Scourge, who immediately gets them working. </p>\n<p>Review @Compendium[savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-tales.A Pirate's Day]{A Pirate's Day} and @Compendium[savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-tales.Ship Board Actions]{Ship Board Actions} to find out more what the pirates do during the day.

This morning she managed to acquire two items of the new crew members, items that they would struggle without the use of. At some point on this first day she will approach the new comers as soon as she can to return equipment and offer her friendship. She can explain the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is not what you know but who you know on a pirate ship.

In addition, each pirates can take a single daytime ship action.</p>\n<p><strong>“Bloody Hour”:</strong> The crew gathers on deck at dusk to witness the keelhauling of Jakes Magpie, a pirate caught stealing from the quartermaster's store the night before. After a brief interrogation at the hands of Mr. Lagraa and Master Scourge, Jakes admitted his crime, and is now brought up from the @Compendium[savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-tales.Bilges]{bilges} to be slowly keelhauled before the evening meal. A successful @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} can see the relish with which Mr. Lagraa, in particular, tugs at the rope as the unfortunate Magpie is dragged under the ship. What appears on the other side has been cut to shreds and is soon thrown overboard to feed the sharks.</p>\n<p>A pirate who examines the body before it is dumped can make a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Healing]{Healing} check to estimate that the unfortunate Jakes took significant damage from the punishment and drowned as well.

{"_id":"QygQfqdlw5zh5IkL","name":"Ship Punishments","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Ship Punishments</h1>\n<p>To maintain the obedience and effectiveness of their crews, most captains enforce strict schedules and shipboard laws upon their vessels, all maintained by the swift dispensation of brutal punishments. The following presents (in order of severity) the game effects of a variety of typical nautical punishments, which the pirates have the potential to face or inflict during their piratical careers. Most of these sentences are meted out just before the evening meal, at an event typically referred to as the bloody hour. Victims are tied to the whipping post on the main deck and their backs stripped for punishment—with penalties doubled for those who resist. </p>\n<h3>Rope Bash</h3>\n<p>Little more than an admonishment—and occasionally used as a sign of endearment—a rope bash is a single attack with the hefty, sealed end of a ship’s rope.</p>\n<h3>The Lash</h3>\n<p>This is an attack using a whip. Lashes during bloody hour require a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Vigor} check (+1) for every three lashes or cause one level of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}.</p>\n<h3>Cat-o’-Nine-Tails</h3>\n<p>This is an attack using a cat-o’-ninetails, also referred to simply as a cat—lashes with the cat require a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Vigor} check (–1) one level of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} for every three strikes.</p>\n<h3>Confined in the Sweatbox</h3>\n<p>A cramped metal box left on deck and exposed to the sun, a sweatbox is terribly confining and replicates unbearably hot conditions. Each four hours in the sweatbox the victim must make a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Vigor} check or suffer a level of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}. There is a –1 to this check for each 8 hours they spend in the sweat box. Any creature with fire resistance is immune to the effects of the sweatbox. Victims typically spend 8, 12 or even 24 hours locked up in the sweatbox.</p>\n<h3>Keelhauling</h3>\n<p>The most frightful of pirate punishments is keelhauling, as it generally ends in death—often by decapitation. Being keelhauled involves being tied to a rope looped over a ship’s keel and dragged down one side of a ship, underwater across the barnacle encrusted hull, and up the other side. Keelhauling can be done either fast or slow. If done fast, the barnacles cut deep and flense the victim, dealing 2d6 points of damage per round. If done slow, shallower cuts are incurred, dealing 1d6 damage per round, but the risk of drowning increases. How long keelhauling takes typically depends on the vessel, with a keelhauling on a ship like the <em>Storm Reaver</em> taking 6 rounds if done fast and 12 rounds if done slow.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_f5h8exvluwf","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Ship lore","color":"#000000"}}}

Drawing near, the group sees signs of a recent and bloody battle—several large holes are clearly visible in her side and corpses litter the splintered, bloodsoaked deck.</p>\n<p>As the heroes watch, a lone figure staggers onto the deck from the rear cabins. Spying them, the figure tries to reach the side of ship, waving frantically as he lurches forward. He barely makes half a dozen steps before he falls lifeless to the planks.</p>\n<p>On boarding, the heroes discover a scene of absolute carnage. A successful Common Knowledge roll reveals most of the injuries were not inflicted in battle. Most of the corpses have been horribly mutilated in some way. Characters failing a Fear check are violently sick and gain a level of Fatigue which is only recovered 30 minutes after leaving the Conquistador.</p>\n<h2>The Survivor</h2>\n<p>The survivor is unconscious and badly bleeding. Both of his hands have been severed at the wrists and his nose has been hacked off. A successful Healing roll staunches the blood flow and returns the man to consciousness. Once awake, he tells his tale.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“My name is Jim Black, ship’s cook. Pirates attacked us barely two hours ago. Having no escort, the captain saw fit to surrender, planning on trading the cargo for our lives. He assembled us on the deck and raised a flag of surrender. The swines raked the deck with grapeshot before boarding.</p>\n<p>“The captain offered his cargo without a struggle but the pirate captain shot him on the spot. They took the cargo but they had no intention of letting us live. The pirate captain had every man butchered—gutted some, amputated limbs off others, and even made some of them eat their own body parts.</p>\n<p>“That devil hacked off my nose and tried to make me eat it. I put on a brave face, hoping he’d show mercy if I didn’t beg, and said it needed pepper. He asked my trade, and when I told him he hacked my hands off and left me here to die. What use am I now with no hands, eh? There’s still cargo below if you want it—I’m not going to put up a fight.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>Jim describes the pirate captain. Any character who took part in  The Low Down (157) and makes a Common Knowledge roll recognizes the man as the mariner they rescued. Jim adds that the pirate ship was a galleon called the Mad Dog and it sailed away east.</p>\n<p>Below deck are two cargo spaces worth of food—Low’s ship lacked room to store the entire cargo.</p>\n<h2>Hunting the Mad Dog</h2>\n<p>If the heroes decline the cargo and set off immediately, the Mad Dog has a three-hour lead. Taking the Conquistador’s cargo increases the lead to six hours. How much head start Low has is irrelevant—but don’t tell the group.</p>\n<p>Believing the Conquistador’s crew to be dead, Low is in no rush to escape. Riding hard with the wind, the heroes spy a sail on the horizon shortly before dusk. Use the standard Chase rules. When the ships draw level, Low recognizes the heroes as his rescuers and shouts across to them.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“Well strike me down! I never thought I’d see you fine chaps again. I have no beef with you lads—you did get me a good turn and that’s a rare thing. I’ll return the favor now—turn sail and run ‘n I’ll let you go in peace. Continue your present course and I’ll watch you eat your own lips as you beg for mercy.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>Low will actually let the heroes sail away in peace if they choose to turn around. Should they cross his path a second time he has no hesitation about killing them—he considers the favor repaid in full. Of course, he’ll also take great delight in boarding their ship and cutting off their lips if they try to slug it out.</p>\n<p>If the group loses the fight and surrenders, Low does indeed cut off their lips, as well as their ears and noses—each character gains the Ugly Hindrance—before letting them go as a warning to others.</p>\n<h3>The Mad Dog (Galleon)</h3>\n<p>Acc/Top Speed: 2/12; Travel Speed: 3; Handling: –3; Toughness: 20(4); Crew: 30+40; Cargo Space: 6; Guns: 20 Notes: Heavy Armor; Low has sacrificed cargo space for additional cannons.</p>\n<p>Pirates (65): 60 Pirates and five Veteran Pirate officers (p. 195).</p>\n<p>Booty: A King’s Ransom aboard the Mad Dog.

Seventeen men slid into the sea, gasping for air in that cold, cold water. Two of ‘em, a pair of warforged, even went below to fight ‘em but they never returned. I lay on a block of ice with my arm half-frozen in the slab. Had to hack it off with my own knife. Then I kicked my way home and ain’t set foot on a ship since.</p>\n<p>That drake ain’t got no special bounty on him, but there’s somethin’ most o’ the locals don’t know. The success of my crew was in no small part to Hastor, my artificer. That beast swallowed hastor whole. On his hand was a magical ring, a relic he used to go beneath the waves like a merfolk. He could go to any depth, stay under for days, and swim like a shark. I’ve cut open a dozen drake turtles and I’ve found trinkets galore in their gizzards. They stick in there, it seems.

As pirates and sailors fall or are thrown into the sea, let the swabs hear their screams as they’re ripped apart by sharks. Finally, describe the hush that falls over the two ships as the battle finally nears its end.</p>\n<h3>Hold the quarterdeck</h3>\n<p>As the <em>Storm Reaver</em> closes to within half a mile of the <em>Majestic Griffon</em>, Riaris Krine summons the swabs to the <em>Storm Reaver's</em> poop deck to give them their task for the upcoming battle.</p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“The ship’s wheel is on the aft deck, just below the sterncastle.

The swabs can choose two hostile or unfriendly NPCs if they wish—people do die in battle after all.</p>\n<h3>The Sea</h3>\n<p>The captain orders Fishguts and the cook's mate to slaughter a pig and throw it overboard to attract sharks for the coming battle.</p>\n<p>If a sailor or pirate falls overboard there is a 1 in 3 chance each round that they are attacked by a Shark.

The swabs will have up to four rounds worth of actions to fire or cast spells on the other ship before the ships close enough for boarding. Each round there is a 40% chance the swab is attacked by a crossbow. </p>\n<p>After 4 rounds, the two ships collide, and the pirates begin hurling grapples and lowering planks to board the Majestic Griffon. The ships remain locked together until the battle ends.</p>\n<h3>Round 1: Boarding Action</h3>\n<p>The swabs must cross from the <em>Storm Reaver's</em> quarterdeck to the <em>Majestic Griffon's</em> aftcastle. 6 sailors guard the aftcastle plus the pilot.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-bestiary.Sailor]{Sailor} (6)</li>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-bestiary.Pilot]{Pilot} (1)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Round 3: The Prince's Back</h3>\n<p>At this point in the battle the fog parts, allowing the swabs to see Prince Mike Rockface, Riaris Krine, and Gragoth rushing towards the doors leading to the second deck below. Have the swabs make <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}</strong> checks. Those that succeed notice a sailor sneaking up behind Prince Rockface.

If the swabs don't warn the Prince, the sailor will strike a non-fatal blow from behind. Once slaying the sailor, Prince Rockface will look around and notices the swabs could have warned her.</p>\n<h3>Round 6: Fleeing Sailors</h3>\n<p>Three sailors appear out of the fog, hoping to release one of the ships boats and flee. They must make two <strong>@Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}</strong> checks to release the boat and one to jump aboard.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-bestiary.Sailor]{Sailor} (3)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Round 7-10: The Battle Turns</h3>\n<p>Through the fog, the swabs can see the crew scattering or surrendering.

The fog dissipates, and a line of prisoners from the Man’s Promise is paraded before Prince Rockface and the cheering crew of the <em>Storm Reaver</em>.</p>\n<p>Aboard the <em>Storm Reaver</em>, a party begins as the pirates celebrate their victory with fine food and drink from the <em>Majestic Griffon’s</em> hold. Prince Rockface holds a meeting with his top officers and divvies up the plunder from the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> among the crew in the early evening. Bolstered by gold and good drink, the party lasts for 36 hours, well into the next night. Naturally, no work takes place during the party. During this time, the swabs can take up to 5 ship actions of their choice, or do nothing but drink and revel like most of the pirate crew does.</p>\n<p><strong>Treasure:</strong> Each swab receives 150 gp in coinage as his or her share of the booty, modified by the following factors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the swabs took the aft deck and sterncastle within 6 rounds, they receive two @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Potion of Healing, Major]{Potion of Healing, Major} and a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Potion of Invisibility, Minor]{Potion of Invisibility, Minor}, and each is awarded an additional 100 gp.</li>\n<li>If a swab warned Prince Rockface as he was being attacked in Round 3, the swabs receive an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Amulet of Natural Armor, Minor]{Amulet of Natural Armor, Minor}.

This reward increases to 200 gp if the swabs managed to capture the officer alive.</li>\n<li>For each pirate accidentally killed, deduct 150 gp from the party’s reward.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> If any swabs did not take part in the battle and are discovered, they are accused of cowardice and given a dozen lashes with the cat before the plunder is distributed. Such characters forfeit their share of the booty.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"quick-encounters":{"quickEncounter":"{\"journalEntryId\":\"MMMTZcygBDdHuIMw\",\"extractedActors\":[{\"numActors\":1,\"dataPackName\":\"savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-bestiary\",\"actorID\":\"KEeR7YOKnWikm2I1\",\"name\":\" Krornik Kragshard\",\"savedTokensData\":[],\"generatedTokensData\":[{\"actorId\":\"KEeR7YOKnWikm2I1\",\"isSavedToken\":false}],\"combinedTokensData\":[{\"actorId\":\"KEeR7YOKnWikm2I1\",\"isSavedToken\":false}]}],\"hideQE\":true,\"qeVersion\":\"0.8.4\"}"},"cf":{"id":"temp_n10pg472em","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Season 1: Mutiny Against the Cloudreavers","color":"#000000"}}}

Should anyone inquire about his odd pallor, a bartender or serving wench relates that his name is Caleb Candelas, a masaquani sailor. Everyone knows he was on the Arkanaus, a frigate that went down a few miles east a month back. Most of the survivors shipped out soon after for warmer climes, but Candelas stayed on and recently bought a sealsuit. No one knows what happened after that, but he hasn’t left yet.</p>\n<p>If Candelas is approached, he is reluctant to discuss his history unless the group seems reasonably trustworthy (A Persuasion roll at –2, no more than one attempt every 10 minutes). Finally, Candelas spills the beans.</p>\n<p>“Aye. I was aboard the Arkanaus. She was full of gunpowder. Pirates hit her and blew out the back. Men were blasted to bits. I saw one man’s body fly north while his legs went south, still kicking. The Cold Sea ran red that day.</p>\n<p>All that blood must have stirred up the fish. Orcas and norwhales set in on us as the ship went down. The pirates was merciful enough to pick up the survivors. Them they could get to before the fish. Some of my mates joined ‘em. A few of us were set off here.”</p>\n<p>If the party pushes Caleb or asks about the sealsuit, a second Persuasion roll might make Caleb tell the rest of the tale.</p>\n<p>The Arkanaus carried gunpowder and gold. The powder is ruined of course, but the gold still sits there in the icy depths. I tried to get to it but the water is rife with orcas and norwhales. It ain’t a job for one man with the shakes.</p>\n<p>If you’ll give me half the treasure, I’ll tell you exactly where the ship went down. You’ll need sealsuits though, the water around here will kill you in seconds without ‘em, less you’re a grael.”</p>\n<h2>The Wreck</h2>\n<p>Candelas is happy to guide the group to where the ship went down, three miles southeast of Kaja on the Cold Sea. It’s easy to find the Arkanaus’ exact location for it’s about 100 yards due north of a small spire of gray rock called the Finger. As Caleb said, the water here is 60’ deep and infested with orcas and norwhales.</p>\n<p>Anyone using the environmental protection spell is protected from the freezing waters, but all others except grael must have a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Seal Suit]{seal suit}.</p>\n<p>As Candelas promised, a chest of gold lies in a locked stockroom of the Arkanaus. A few minutes worth of work on the door or its lock opens the way. The chest weighs over 100 pounds and contains a King’s Ransom in various treasures, including one relic (rolled randomly from the Relic Table).</p>\n<h2>Orcas</h2>\n<p>The smell of the sealsuits and the sound of breaking into the storeroom attracts two orcas. These beasts are hungry and quite intelligent, so they’re more than happy to circle the wreck for a while to wait out their prey. They might also try a few nudges against the hull. The orcas are more than capable of busting through the sides of the Arkanaus to get at the tasty morsels within. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Killer Whale]{Orcas} (2):</span> Two killer whales roam the area (p. 194).</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_slwk1t4xhcl","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Savage Tales","color":"#000000"}}}

The current owner of the Rock is Vilina Kessler, widow of the late Saal the Bear. Though Lady Kessler is a competent and formidable figure, without any of her late husband’s ships or network of castles, the Lady of the Rock has fallen upon hard times. Lady Kessler’s forces have been reduced to a small body of loyal guards and a few family retainers whom she employs to eke out a living.</p>\n<section class=\"secret gm-secret\">\n<p>The Rock still commands some treasures—its favorable location, its security, and the late captain’s fabled iron shirt from which he gained his nickname—but it is otherwise remote and at the mercy of what the sea chooses to throw upon its shores.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>History of Tidewater Rock</h3>\n<p>A few centuries ago there was a period of time of increased piracy within the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities]{Lhazaar Principalities}. A lord in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Karrnath]{Karrnath} with strong family ties to the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities]{Lhazaar Principalities} saw a particular island as a strong means to handle the piracy. After discovering a natural harbor on @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Windward Isle]{Windward Isle}, Lady Anastro ir' Ondric got a land grant from the crown of Galifar and laid claim to the island. Starting with just one ship and a small encampment on Winward's natural harbor, she set about her work. She was able to build a keep, which was named Tidewater Rock, she began clearing the sea lanes. Little did the king know that Lady Anastro was using this as an opportunity to get rid of competition. From the vantage point atop the Rock , she found she could attack particularly ripe targets while receiving ample warning of hostile ships approaching. So she was able to reduce the piracy on the sea lands while simultanously engaging in her own piracy to expand the keep and her fleet.</p>\n<p>Over time, ir'Ondric's successes both politically and on the seas enabled her to build a sizeable fleet, as well as more strongholds on several different islands in the Fever Sea and lands on the mainland. She became a scourge in the Lhazaar while at the same time keeping enough traffic flowing that the crown was happy. Shortly after claiming the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport} she was assassinated. Ir'Ondric's burgeoning principality fell apart among its squabbling captains. Oydelis Helmworth, first mate of ir'Ordic's flagship, <em>The Immortal Karrn, </em>siezed control of the Rock. Within only a few years, Helmworth became a powerful force in the Principalities, and the legend of Tidewater Rock as both a powerful good luck talisman and an impregnable bastion was born.</p>\n<p>Over the many years since, control of Tidewater Rock has passed from hand to hand, and its strategic location and practical defensibility have enabled its owners to enrich themselves substantially, particularly after the Last War started and the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities]{Lhazaar Principalities} went back to it's old ways. During the middle of the Last War the fleet from Tidewater Rock encountered a major setback in a naval battle with a Karrn fleet, that corresponded with a rise in the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Seadragon Principality]{Seadragon Principality}, Tidewater Rock became of less strategic importance and the owners came to be of less prominence.  Yet the age-old axiom of “Good fortune and sure sail await what one can crack the Tidewater Rock” has stood the test of time among the pirates of the Lhazaar and is oft-quoted—if seldom heeded—even today.</p>\n<p>The most recent lord of Tidewater Rock was Saal the Bear, captain of the <em>Vale</em> and three other brigs. Like his predecessors, he held Tidewater Rock as his seat, but controlled a few other small castles on surrounding islands as well.</p>\n<p>Over a decade ago, “The Bear” went to sea with his small fleet in a feud with Prince Kel and was never seen again. Rumor has it that Prince Kel had lured Saal into the edges of the the Gray Tide and ambushed him with the help of a previously unknown ally—one Mike Rockface—and that Saal’s fleet was cut to pieces between the enemy fleets. Other rumors report that ambush was conducted by nothing but ships from the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Gray Tide Principality]{Gray Tide Principality}, using one ship as bait to lure Saal into the Gray Tide. Regardless rumors say \"the Bear\" was last seen on the deck of the crippled and sinking <em>Vale</em> at the mercy of the mists of the Gray Tide.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>Prince Rockface took control of several of Saal’s undefended castles. She made an attempt to take the Tidewater Rock as well, only to discover those loyal to Saal's had taken charge of its defenses. Multiple attacks of Prince Rockface have been unsuccessful.</p>\n</section>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork/icons/sweb-logo.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":4200000},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_9r4pv5h5ul5","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar Lore#/CF_SEP/Lhazaar Principalities#/CF_SEP/02.09.04.

{"_id":"a5dWjtPnSBr1tjnt","name":"Ship Roles","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Ship Roles</h1>\n<p>All crew members on any ship have specific roles and responsibilities, often with harsh punishments being meted out upon those who shirk their duties. Listed here are some of the standard roles aboard a typical ship. Not all of these roles might be represented on every vessel, but such details can help players understand their characters’ daily duties.</p>\n<h2>Officers</h2>\n<h3>Captain</h3>\n<p>The ultimate authority on any ship responsible for the ship and everything aboard her, his word is law to all on board. The captain chooses where to sail, what are fitting punishments for breeches in discipline,  and who fills the other stations aboard the vessel, among many other command decisions. The captain is the voice of the crew to all beyond the ship. In terms of daily duties, the captain keeps a log of the voyage, manages the affairs of the ship through the officers, working with the navigator to plot courses, and generally serves a four to six hour shift at the helm. Leadership can prove perilous, however, as a captain is, above all, meant to secure success for his ship and crew. Failing to do so increases the threat of mutiny.</p>\n<h3>First Mate</h3>\n<p>The first mate is the number two man on the ship. She is responsible for enforcing the ship’s articles and administering punishment when necessary. The first mate is the trustee of the ship and her crew, often being elected by the crew to the position. She directly represents the crew to the captain. It is her responsibility to serve as a counterbalance to the captain in decisions that might be hazardous to the ship or the crew. A wise captain makes no decisions that his first mate doesn't support. The first mate takes responsibility for prize vessels and picks the treasure that the crew will take from a prize. She is also responsible for counting the booty and splitting the shares according to each crewmembers due. Each day will find her working with her subordinate officers the boatswain, the master gunner, and the master at arms to effectively run the ship. The first mate also serves a turn at the helm, generally a four to six hour shift.</p>\n<h3>Navigator</h3>\n<p>The navigator is responsible for plotting the ship’s course and maintaining that course, thus requiring an strong education and excellent all around seamanship. The navigator maintains all of the ship’s charts and maps as well as the tools of navigation. He is charged with keeping a daily log of every event relating to the sailing of the ship. He records the depth, the currents, the wind patterns, the ship’s location, the locations of reefs and sandbars, and the state of the rigging. He reports directly to the captain. The pilot oversaw the work of the sail-master and almost always has at least one assistant (a pilot’s mate) to help him with his duties. The pilot and his mate both serve separate shifts at the helm in addition to taking readings from the moons and stars to plot and maintain the course.</p>\n<h3>Boatswain</h3>\n<p>The boatswain, or bosun (pronounced “bosun” either way), is responsible for maintaining the ship's seaworthy status. This makes the boatswain accountable for all rope, rigging, anchors, and sails. His duties were to make certain that all the work of running the ship is done. This would also include keeping the watches and maintaining discipline among the deck crew. At the start of the day, the boatswain and those under her weigh anchor, raise the sails and report on the general condition of the ship’s deck to the first mate. The boatswain was often the most feared man on the ship because his obligations often made him uncompromising. It was his responsibility to keep everything “ship-shape”. Day and night, the boatswain drives the crew to do whatever work is required. He maintains the watch log and reports any problems to the first mate.</p>\n<h3>Coxswain</h3>\n<p>The coxswain (who could be a bosun’s mate and is pronounced 'cox’n') steered the ship (when he could be known as the helmsman) and was in charge of any small boats on board - useful for going ashore, exploring shallows, and boarding other vessels.</p>\n<h3>Quartermaster</h3>\n<p>The quartermaster oversees all the supplies and items stored aboard the ship. She maintains the supplies of food, water, sails, rope, wood, and tar, oversees the disbursement of food to the cook, and doles out the rum ration to the crew. The quartermaster also directs the loading of cargo into the hold to maintain the proper ballast to ensure level sailing.</p>\n<h3>Artificer/Mage</h3>\n<p>Many ships that ply the waters around Khorvaire have an artificer and/or mage on board. They can be responsible for the functioning of any magical locomotion of the ship, repairs, general arcane knowledge or any number of other magical needs the ship might have. They are also expected to contribute firepower or counter enemy magical firepower in any ship to ship conflicts that happen on the vessel. </p>\n<h3>Master-at-Arms</h3>\n<p>The Master at Arms is often the most skilled warrior on the crew. He is responsible for training the crew in hand to hand combat. He also leads the ship’s boarding parties and hunting parties when they are necessary. The Master at Arms position is not a separate position on every vessel and often these responsibilities fall to the first mate or quartermaster. When the master at arms position is filled on a ship, he takes orders from and reports to the first mate.</p>\n<h3>Master Gunner</h3>\n<p>The master gunner is in charge of all shipboard artillery, ensuring the weapons are kept in good working order, repaired, and that the crew knows how to use them. She maintains the ballistas, catapults, and so on. The master gunner picks, trains and runs the gunnery crew. He reports to the first mate, but was responsible to the entire ship to make sure the artillery hits the target. He day to day duties consists of drilling the gunnery crew and maintaining the weapons.</p>\n<h2>Crew</h2>\n<h3>Cabin Boy/Girl</h3>\n<p>Servant to the captain and other officers, this low-ranking and typically young crew member assists other sailors in their duties and runs various errands across the ship, requiring him or her to gain a measure of understanding of almost all the ship’s roles.</p>\n<h3>Carpenter</h3>\n<p>No matter what enchantments or alchemical unguents augment a pirate ship, its heart and bones are still wood. This simple fact makes the carpenter one of the most important positions aboard any vessel. Carpenters are chiefly responsible for maintaining the ship below the deck, finding and plugging leaks, repairing damage, and replacing masts and yards. Carpenters are also responsible for the construction of barrels and crates as necessary to store cargo. The carpenter reports to the boatswain.</p>\n<h3>Cook</h3>\n<p>While the quartermaster normally allocates the rations, the cook and his apprentices make and distribute meals to the crew. Although some better-outfitted vessels employ skilled cooks to attend to the captain and the officers, many cooks are drawn from crew members who have suffered crippling injuries, allowing them to still serve even after such trauma.The cook takes orders from either the quartermaster or the boatswain.</p>\n<p>Cooper</p>\n<p>A cooper was only found on board a larger vessel, but he was very useful as he could assemble barrels, a key skill because, at the time, these were the only large containers available and were used for keeping dry stores, wet stores, water, rum, and gunpowder in. He ensured they remained as airtight and watertight as possible, and he could dismantle empty barrels to increase space for newly captured cargo. The cooper also made and repaired buckets.</p>\n<h3>Healer</h3>\n<p>Many ships have a healer on board to tend to any injuries that happen. Whether this is a House Jorasco healer, Jorasco trained, or some herbalist with slight training in healing, depends on the vessel. The healer takes orders from the first mate.</p>\n<h3>Rigger</h3>\n<p>Riggers work the rigging and unfurl the sails. In battle, next to that of a boarding party, the riggers’ job is one of the most dangerous, as they pull enemy vessels near enough to board. Riggers report to the sail-master and the boatswain.</p>\n<h3>Sail-Master</h3>\n<p>The Sail-master is the most experienced crewman in the rigging and usually one of the best sailors on the ship. He is responsible for maintaining the sails and the rigging. The Sail-master knows every knot, line, rope, block and tackle in the rigging as well as how to repair them all. He is also responsible for training and running the sail crew as well as overseeing the making and patching of sails. The Sail-master takes orders from and reports to the navigator.</p>\n<h3>Sailmaker</h3>\n<p>Like the carpenter, blacksmith, and cooper, this was a specialist artisan job, and the man skilled at it need not necessarily know any other skills of seamanship. Sails were always worn down by weather, often ripped up by storms, and sometimes riddled to pieces by siege weapons or magic.</p>\n<h3>Swab</h3>\n<p>Any sailor who mops the decks. Also used as slang for any low-ranking or unskilled crew member.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_f5h8exvluwf","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Ship lore","color":"#000000"},"_document-sheet-registrar":{},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"}}}

Several strands of thick rope are secured to the foot of the mainmast for use as a whipping post. An Escape Artist check (DC 20 + the binder’s CMB) is required to escape the bonds.

{"_id":"e8jhDVoMZBZ4P6hq","name":"Treasure for the Taking","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Treasure for the Taking</h1>\n<section class=\"secret gm-secret\">\n<p>Combine this with elements from Pirate's Bounty and the Isle of Fire Eberron Adventure.</p>\n</section>\n<p>“Stumpy” Pete, a regular at the Shipwreck Surprise, has two wooden legs (hence the name). Since being washed up on the island last year he has worked as Azy’s accountant— he’s not much use as a farmer or sailor. The locals suspect he has a hidden stash of treasure somewhere on the island but countless searches have revealed nothing.</p>\n<p>Stumpy approaches the group while they are drinking in the tavern. He invites them to join him for a drink and to partake in a business venture.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“Name’s Stumpy Pete,” he slurs, obviously the worse for drink. “Afore I came to the cay I was a pirate by trade working under a French corsair by the name of Pierre La Grange. He was small fry compared to some—at least until we found treasure.</p>\n<p>“While exploring an island north of the Whips we discovered a stash of treasure buried in a ruined building. We was only a small crew, just the ten of us, but we struck it rich beyond our wildest dreams. Gold, silver, and jewels in abundance just waiting for us to find it.</p>\n<p>“We took what we could carry and left the rest, planning on returning when we could. The captain said carrying too much would make us an easy target if other pirates found out. We spent most of our loot in Baltimus before heading to Shark Bay to acquire a larger ship. Never made it that far though. The ship sank in a storm somewhere off the coast of this island. I was lucky—I was washed up here. Lost my other leg but at least I’m alive.</p>\n<p>“I can tell you doubt my story and I don’t blame you. If you want some proof the treasure exists then look no further.” With that, he removes his right leg and holds it upside down over the table. A small bag slides out and lands with a soft clunk. Stumpy opens the bag to reveal two dozen small diamonds.</p>\n<p>“This is just a taste of what we found. I can’t trust these pirates to help me, but if you’ll take me to the island I’ll share the booty with you— fifty-fifty.”</p>\n</aside>\n</section>\n<p>No one on the island knows Stumpy has the gems—he exchanges them for coin with visiting crews. The treasure is real and the offer genuine. Hard bargaining and a raise on a Persuasion roll can increase the group’s share to 75% of the haul. The only thing “Stumpy” failed to mention was the horrible creature guarding the treasure—another reason he has never returned to the island.</p>\n<p>Stumpy Pete Pete lost his first leg to grapeshot and the second when he was shipwrecked off Azy Cay. He is content with his life on the Cay—he has a steady job, his own shack, and his booty goes further than it would in a big city. All he wants now is the rest of the treasure to see him through in comfort to his dying days.

Rising steeply from the sea, the cliffs tower 100 feet above the surrounding water. Atop is a rugged plateau covered in dense forest. Aside from a small colony of monkapes and some razor wings the island is uninhabited. Actually that isn’t true—the Sea Hags know about the treasure and sent a guardian to watch over it. (See below for details.)</p>\n<p>Scaling the cliffs requires three Climbing rolls. Failure results in a drop of 1d6 x 5 yards. Stumpy can’t climb and must be winched to the top.</p>\n<p>After getting his bearings, Stumpy leads the group north through the forest. The short walk to the ruin involves crossing rugged ground and hacking through the forest—not to mention having to walk at Stumpy’s slow pace. Have everyone make Vigor rolls. A failure results in a level of Fatigue, recovered after 15 minutes rest.</p>\n<p>The ruin once served as a Kieran noble’s hunting retreat but fell into disuse after the Flood. The owner and servants are all dead— drowned in an attempt to cross the Flotsam Sea and reach the “safety” of Kiera. Thick vines cling to the walls and only the main entrance shows any sign of disturbance—this is where “Stumpy” and his crew entered last year.</p>\n<p>The treasure belonged to a pirate (now resting at the bottom of sea) who found the island several years ago and thought it a safe place to conceal his loot.</p>\n<p>Have the characters make Notice rolls. On a success, they realize Stumpy has grown very nervous, wringing his hands and glancing quickly from side to side. If questioned he says, “Strange being back that’s all. Reminds me of my dead shipmates. Come on, the loot’s in the ballroom. Let’s get it and go.”</p>\n<p>Stumpy leads the group to the ballroom and points to some flagstones in the far corner. The stones lift easily to reveal six chests, each full to bursting with treasure. Disturbing the chests alerts the Sea Hags’ guardian lurking in the forest nearby. It attacks as the group leaves the ruin.</p>\n<p> Guardian Beast: The guardian beast is actually a giant zombie monkape, placed here by the Sea Hags to guard the treasure. Use the statistics for a regular giant monkape (p. 192) but add the Fear, Fearless, and Undead Special Ability (as per a zombie). The beast concentrates its attacks on the character carrying the mummified head.</p>\n<p> Booty: Two King’s Ransoms. In addition there is a golden triangle engraved with strange writing and a wooden box containing a mummified head.</p>\n<h2>Mummified Head</h2>\n<p>The head is the true reason the Sea Hags sent a guardian to the island. It belonged to a powerful archmage who sacrificed his life to give the inhabitants of Caribdus a chance to defeat the three sisters. The head is alive—sort of—and can still use its magic. When the lid is lifted the eyes open and a disembodied voices speaks to the heroes, “My magic is yours to command but only against the three sisters.”</p>\n<p>It has 50 Power Points, a d12+2 Spellcasting, and knows every spell, but can only cast them in the final battles against the Sea Hags. Power Points are not recharged—once the last one is spent the head crumbles to dust.</p>\n<p>Neither the Hags nor their minions can touch the head or affect it with magic—hence the zombie monkape guardian.</p>\n<p>If the group has already defeated the Sea Hags the head is less powerful—it can teach a mage a single spell, ignoring the usual rank requirement. This takes 2d6 hours of instruction, after which the mage may add to spell to his repertoire. The head then crumbles to dust.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_4s6bxi84dvu","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Savage Tales#/CF_SEP/The Dragonshards","color":"#000000"}}}

Gone! No one would help us after the Mournland rolled through. We were even forgotten from the negotiating table at the laughable Treaty of Thronehold. As well intended as Prince Oargev might be, New Cyre is on Brelish land. There no telling when the \"generosity\" of that throne (or the Parliment) will want their land back. There is little hope that the Mournland can be reversed. Even if it could, there is not enough Cyrans left to stop the rush of Karrns, Thranes, and Brelanders that would come in to take the land. </p>\n<p>If Cyre is to survive, you need to take matters into your own hands. You have lived your life on the sea for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre]{Cyre}, so it's time to take what you know and see how you can support Cyre. Since nobody seems to care about Cyrans, maybe it is time to take what we can to give to those Cyrans who now have nothing. So now it is time to turn to piracy to help out the Cryans that survive. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities]{Lhazaar Principalities} are too chaotic and disjointed now with the largest shipping lanes in Khorvaire after the loss of the Great Canal. It is time to take some of the wealth from those that have so much to help those that have lost so much. Who knows, with a kind eye from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Arawai]{Arawai}, and a blessing from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Devourer]{the Devourer}, maybe you might acquire enough plunder and noteriety (or Infamy) to be able to claim some land or even a prinipality for the survivors of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre]{Cyre}. </p>\n<h2>Campaign Intention</h2>\n<p>In the Pirates of Cyre campaign, you are going to take on the role of Cyrans who survived the Day of Mourning or those friendly and sympathetic to the Cyran plight. Fed up with how Cyrans are being treated by the other nations, you are choosing to use your life long knowledge of the sea, to turn to piracy.</p>\n<p>This campaign is intended to be a very pulpy and swashbuckling in nature. It will start off on some rails, but will open up into a large sand box that will be very much driven by you.</p>\n<p>Your reasons for turning to piracy could include any number of reasons. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prince Oargev, or someone who has his ear, has asked or planted a seed in you to use your skills in this manner to find a new home for Cyrans or at least send money to support New Cyre.</li>\n<li>Perhaps you fear that @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} will eventually kick Cyrans out of New Cyre and leave everyone you know and love left, once again homeless. You can change that.</li>\n<li>You are just plain bitter at any number of the other nations for what they did to Cyre. Either for unjustly starting the new war, what you see as war crimes during the war, shutting their doors to your people in thier time of greatest need, or something else. Regardless, you are only giving them what they deserve.</li>\n<li>You don't trust Prince Oargev to do right by Cyrans. He is too beholden to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland}, so you will take matters into your own hands to help yourselves, and any other Cyrans that can see what you are doing.</li>\n<li>You survived the Day of Mourning by being at sea, and have been here in the Lhazaar for a long time now. The law here is that you keep what you take. This has just finally started to rub off. Why not do this for Cyrans?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regardless of your reasons, the most important thing to keep in mind when creating your character is that piracy plays a significant role in this campaign, and your character should be willing on some level to engage in it. Whether you are pirates with or without honor makes no difference. It also does not matter if you are just interested in plundering wealth just for self or for other Cyrans, raiding, overthrowing an existing prince, or finding land for a new home for Cyre. All these options have a place in this campaign, and you get to decide what that is. Outside of there being piracy, there is no intention to force you players into being a certian kind of pirate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":4},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_sfbrzx24rkb","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Player Character Guide","color":"#000000"},"journal-backlinks":{"references":{}}}}

Led by a twisted druid called the Brinebrood Queen and her beloved son, a freakish and bloated giant grindylow called the Whale, the grindylows have kidnapped a pair of swabs from the <em>Majestic Griffon</em>. The grindylows are always hungry, so they eagerly await any rescuers. </p>\n<p>If the swabs do not discover Riptide Cove while exploring the island, the Brinebrood Queen sends a pair of grindylows, clearly carrying some of the captured pirates’ possessions, to lure more sailors into Riptide Cove. </p>\n<p>If the swabs do not follow them but instead return to the <em>Majestic Griffon </em>to sail away, the Brinebrood Queen orders a full attack, leading all of her followers (except the Whale) into battle against the ship and its crew.</p>\n<h2>Riptide Cove Features</h2>\n<p>Riptide Cove is a series of low natural tunnels and caverns around a deep central chamber known as the Cauldron (area D8). Save for tiny air pockets above some of the larger caverns, the complex is completely submerged at high tide. At low tide, the tunnels are mostly free of water, but many of the caverns remain half-flooded.</p>\n<p>The tunnels are littered with partially eaten bones sucked clean of flesh. The grindylows decorate these bones with strange scrimshaw, and tie them together with sinew to create revolting “sculptures” resembling lurking horrors and twisted sea creatures from the depths, the product of sadistic and almost alien minds. Other features of the caverns are detailed below.</p>\n<p><strong>Riptide:</strong> The caverns are deep, but still subject to the tides. The caverns are almost completely flooded at high tide, which occurs twice per day at roughly 12-hour intervals. The side-view map of the caverns shows the water level at low tide. The waters are very murky because of the endless tides, with a visibility of 10 feet. </p>\n<p><strong>Seaweed:</strong> Seaweed grows thick on all cavern floors between 5 and 8 feet deep. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} checks are required to keep ones balance on the slick surfaces.</p>\n<h3>D1.

{"_id":"k0auIA2dwIxShmV3","name":"Mister Lagraa","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<p>Mister Lagraa is an angry young woman. He’s always furious about something, but somehow her rage simmers like a stew, and even when she loses her temper she quickly seems to gain control again. A sadist and bully, Lagraa has had a hard, desperate life—few places are more dangerous to grow up than the dockside streets of the Shackles. Only 21 years of age, the memories and scars of Lagraa’s formative years are very fresh, and now she intends to have her revenge.</p>\n<p>Lagraa is also incredibly ambitious—he intends to captain her own ship someday, and she joined the crew of the <em>Storm Reaver</em> purely for her own ends. Thanks to her ruthless devotion to Prince Rockface’s orders, her rise has been meteoric. In just 11 months aboard the <em>Storm Reaver</em>, she has wormed, blackmailed, and murdered her way to the position of first mate, in truth a job well beyond her abilities. she masks her own inadequacies by pointing out those of others.</p>\n<p>Everyone on board the <em>Storm Reaver</em> knows that the first mate is the captain’s right hand when it comes to dealing with the ship’s crew, but Prince Rockface’s other officers form a close inner circle that Lagraa can’t seem to penetrate, a fact that vexes him to no end. Nevertheless, Prince Rockface is sure to punish anyone who attacks Mr. Lagraa, a fact that every member of the crew is acutely aware of.</p>\n<p>To Mister Lagraa, honor, friendship, and teamwork are alien concepts. she believes that discipline is the only thing that matters at sea, and that the constant threat of ruthless punishment is the only thing that can keep a crew of cutthroats and scoundrels in line. she strikes first, and asks questions later. Lagraa is not a forgiving woman, and if someone does get the better of him, Lagraa takes time to plot her revenge in the cruelest way she can think of.</p>\n<p>Bald except for a black ponytail and sporting long, narrow beard, Mister Lagraa somehow looks angry, miserable, and uncomfortable, all at the same time. Bare-chested, she wears an immaculate coat with pearl buttons and carries a cat-o’-nine-tails with him at all times. she clearly takes great pride in himself—everything about him shines, from the polish on her boots to the dome of her head. her teeth are gray and yellow, however, and her face is fixed in an almost constant grimace.</p>\n<h2>Gossip</h2>\n<p>The PCs can learn the following about Mister Lagraa with successful Diplomacy checks to gather information.</p>\n<p>DC 5: If Scourge is a bastard, then Mister Lagraa is her mother and father. One piece of advice—do as she says.</p>\n<p>DC 10: First mate? He’s barely been on board a year! The apple of the captain’s eye, that one. Prince Rockface treats him like a son—but not a legitimate one, of course.</p>\n<p>DC 15: That cutlass of her is magical, see, no doubt about that, and she wields that cat like it was her own arm. I’ve seen him using both in combat. Despite her pettish looks, he’s some fighter by all accounts.</p>\n<p>DC 20: People who cross Lagraa end up dead—stabbed, poisoned, throttled, thrown overboard. Take your pick, they always end up dead. she has friends everywhere, high and low.</p>\n<h2>CampaiGn Role</h2>\n<p>Mister Lagraa (and to a similar extent her repulsive sidekick Master Scourge) presents a challenge for you as GM. she is the main villain of the adventure, yet at the beginning she has considerable inf luence and is practically unassailable. The challenge is to make the PCs loathe him without pushing them to openly attack him, an act that results in keelhauling.</p>\n<p>The penalty for murder on the <em>Storm Reaver</em> should be enough to keep a lid on your player’s desires, but be careful not to overuse her bullying. Lagraa oversees the punishments for infractions on the ship, and does so with relish, but it is Master Scourge, her toadying subordinate, who actually carries out most of the disciplining and poisons the first mate’s mind against the PCs. Again, be careful not to overplay the bullying and sadism, but make sure it is prevalent. With care, you can develop a brooding hatred in your players for this nasty piece of work, and they’ll relish their final encounter with him when the chance eventually presents itself.</p>\n<p>If your players are more unequivocal, however, and likely to bring things to a head before leaving the <em>Storm Reaver</em>, you should bluntly remind them of the consequences of murder. If the keelhauling of Jakes Magpie on the first night aboard the ship doesn’t do the trick, you can have an NPC whom the PCs are growing close to kill someone early on in the adventure, and be keelhauled as punishment.</p>\n<p>Mister Lagraa’s burning ambition leads him to make a return later in the Adventure Path should she somehow survive this adventure. At the table, adventures often take a step away from the predicted plot, and “The <em>Storm Reaver</em> Mutiny” is no exception. The PCs’ mutiny aboard the Man’s Promise may transpire earlier than is written, or circumstances might dictate that Lagraa and some of her cronies somehow escape. Lagraa is certain to brood upon her lost influence, while avoiding her former captain at all costs. Prince Rockface is certain to be unforgiving if she finds that Lagraa has lost the Man’s Promise and yet still lives. Lagraa limps away and broods on her failure, slowly whispering words to the powerful and great as she plots her revenge. she can appear again as an accomplice of one of the more powerful pirate lords or as a Free Captain in her own right, with a handpicked crew of cutthroats and a dozen disciplinary officers aboard her new ship, the Severe.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"base","_viewcount":2,"role":"FIrst Mate","location":"The Wormwood","race":"Orc","gender":"","age":"21","eyes":"Green","skin":"","hair":"Black","profession":"","voice":"","faction":"","height":"","weight":"","traits":"","ideals":"","bonds":"","flaws":"","longterm":"","shortterm":"","beliefs":"","secret":"","DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":{"notes":""},"scrollPos":"{\".description\":50}"},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_rxb9n4yk7i","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Season 1: Mutiny Against the Cloudreavers#/CF_SEP/The Storm Reaver#/CF_SEP/Crew of the Storm Reaver","color":"#000000"},"_document-sheet-registrar":{"type":"base"}}}

Rufus’s behavior made Blackbeard look like a saint—he ravaged, looted, and murdered his way across Caribdus until finally being caught by a Kieran fleet just off Torath-Ka. Rufus amassed a fortune in booty but didn’t have it with him when he died— several witnesses confirmed his self-given curse not to rest until he has reclaimed his treasure.

{"_id":"l1ninIZtPqDvOX4a","name":"Thieves in the Night","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Thieves in the Night</h1>\n<p>One night while sitting at the Red Lantern, the heroes are watched by a man named Kimyun Lee, a Korean from Earth, circa 1750. If one of the player characters seems a shady, sneaky sort, Kimyun approaches with a strange offer.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“You do not know me, but I am a businessman here in Deiking. I have been hired by certain parties to find a person of unparalleled skills in stealth and intrusion. Might you know such a person?”</p>\n</section>\n<p>If the character says yes, or points out another of his crew, Kimyun proceeds.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“There is a junk at the harbor called the King of Siam. I am looking for someone to sneak aboard the ship, locate its bell, steal it, and replace it with a duplicate. All without alerting the crew.</p>\n<p>If you are successful, drop the bell in the rain barrel around back of this very establishment by first light. If it is there in the morning, I will meet you for dinner and pay you your reward. If the crew detects your presence, even if you bring me the bell, I will pay each of you 50 pieces of eight. If you manage it without detection, I will pay you 200 pieces of eight each.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>If Kimyun is questioned about the importance of the bell, he says that it is magical but will not say what powers it possesses. This and the task itself are all a test to see if the crew can be trusted. In fact, the King of Siam is Kimyun’s own ship! Kimyun can offer them a longboat to reach the King if they don’t have one of their own.</p>\n<h3>The King of Siam</h3>\n<p>The Siam is anchored a few hundred yards offshore. It’s a typical junk with a skeleton crew of 15, five of whom are on watch at any given time. The rest are likely gambling and drinking in the hold until they pass out or go to sleep, sometime around the witching hour.</p>\n<p>One man sits on each side, and the fifth lurks in the crow’s nest. The sailors aren’t expecting an intrusion, but are fairly watchful. Use the normal rules for Stealth, and be sure to give the characters bonuses for the darkness (+2) and medium cover (+2). If the sailors spot the thieves, they attack.</p>\n<p>Use typical Sailor statistics for the crew (page 199). Those on watch are armed with muskets and short swords.</p>\n<p>The ship’s bell is located under the main mast. If a character doesn’t specifically indicate he’s muffling the knocker somehow, the bell makes a light sound and three of the five guards get a Notice roll to hear it. If they do, they investigate. The same goes for hanging the replacement bell. Hearing the bell doesn’t mean the heroes are detected, however. The guards must actually see the thieves for them to “fail” in this regard.  Sailors (15): p. 199.</p>\n<h2>Completion</h2>\n<p>If the heroes are successful in retrieving the bell without being seen, Kimyun meets them as promised over dinner the next day. He first pays them their reward—under the table—then whispers the following.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“The bell is not magical. This was merely a test to see if you had the skills to retrieve it, and the trustworthiness to bring it to me. If you are interested in a more dangerous but much more lucrative job, meet me at Tonkan Point tonight at midnight. Come prepared for a similar mission.”</p>\n<p>Tonkan Point is a rocky outcropping a mile south of the main harbor. Kimyun and seven mercenaries are waiting there with his longboat. In the boat is a barrel with bright golden bands.</p>\n<p>“A ship in the harbor was loaded with supplies bound for Kiera today. In its hold are a dozen casks of the purest opium. One of them bears golden bands just like the one in the longboat. I want this barrel in its place.</p>\n<p>The pay is 10,000 pieces of eight. If you accept, I will tell you the name of the ship and you can be on your way. We’ll wait here with your payment.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>If the group agrees, Kimyun continues.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“The ship is the Pan Lung. It normally has a crew of 40, but tonight most are carousing in Deiking and will not be back until morning. Those who remain are well-paid and quite competent, I can assure you.</p>\n<p>There are 18 men aboard the ship. Half will be awake and on duty at any given time. They are commanded by a veteran mercenary named Kang. If they catch you, they will torture you to find out who hired you, then kill you. As you might guess, my name is not really Kimyun, so I have little to fear if you fail other than I will try my plan another day.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>Kimyun has been hired by Kieran rebels to “spike” the Emperor’s opium, hopefully killing him or at least driving him so mad even his own advisors will be forced to put him down. The barrel contains opium laced with other poisons that should do the trick. The cask marked in gold trim is the purest blend, a special present to the Mad Emperor from the Deiking warlords.</p>\n<h2>The Pan Lung</h2>\n<p>This is another typical junk, surprisingly similar to the King of Siam. This time however, two guards sit on each side, and one stands in the crow’s nest. Kang frequently wanders the decks as well. It may be difficult for the heroes to slip into the hold undetected, but this time they can use a distraction if they want. It’s okay if Kang and his guards know they’ve been raided—as long as they don’t realize the Emperor’s opium has been spiked.</p>\n<p>How your group manages to pull off this monumental feat is up to them, of course.</p>\n<p> Guards (18): The 18 crew are Veteran Pirates (p. 195). Kang is a Pirate Captain.</p>\n<h2>Failure</h2>\n<p>If they are discovered, Kang does indeed bind and torture them for all they know. The captain of the ship, Minh Dhai, returns a few hours after first light with some of the crew. He sits in on the torture, makes a report for the warlords, and then waits in harbor for a day for their reply. Most likely, the heroes either spill their guts or die in the process (see below). Once Dhai has all the information he feels he can glean from the prisoners, he sends them to the prison for a public beheading. This occurs 1d4 days later and is a good time to give your heroes a chance to escape.</p>\n<p>Withstanding Kang’s gruesome torture techniques is a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Spirit} roll at –6 each day. Those who fail tell him everything he wants to know. Clever lies reduce the penalty to –4.</p>\n<h2>Success</h2>\n<p>If the cask is successfully replaced, Kimyun greets them on the shore and pays them the ransom as promised—though he demands they leave Deiking immediately and not return for many months. He’s not above a double-cross if they’ve angered him in some way, but mostly he wants them paid and off the island.</p>\n<p> Kimyun and Guards (50): Use typical Veteran Pirate stats for the mercenaries (p. 195).

And so, he was in Aruldusk in Thrane when the war started, and joined up with the Brelish war efforts - there wasn't much else going on for him at the time.

{"_id":"qMs0i36GomVofKpj","name":"Jailbreak","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Jailbreak</h1>\n<p>The heroes have put into a port somewhere in the Kieran Empire and asked about Tomas De Orinjo, a fire mage. A successful Streetwise roll reveals the following.</p>\n<p>“The fire mage? Yeah. I heard o’ him. Served aboard the Valiant. I think they’re privateering in the channel. Y’ might ask the Harbor Master where they’re at now. Sometimes he knows, sometimes he don’t. Depends on how much gold you have.”</p>\n<p>Harbor Masters are not supposed to reveal the locations of any ships—especially those sailing on behalf of the Emperor. Fortunately for our heroes, all of the Kieran Harbor Masters are entangled in graft and corruption.</p>\n<p>Grambus Gramm is the Harbor Master of the first city the heroes’ approach. He is a tall, gaunt masaquani with scars from a profession in pirating a few years back.</p>\n<p>Gramm at first says no, but if someone makes a convincing speech and makes a Persuasion roll, he hints that such information would be worth 5,000 pieces of eight to the right parties (him). Threats of violence won’t get far—a dozen members of the City Watch are stationed with the Harbor Master and more can be summoned by whistles. Reporting him for allegedly taking bribes won’t work either—the Harbor Master has many friends in this city and about the empire in general.</p>\n<p>His fee paid, the Harbor Master stands and leaves the room, a recent letter open on his desk. It reads from the captain of the Valiant stating that he will “report to Paltos with the latest load of brigands as ordered.” He plans to refit there for a few weeks and will then continue his patrols afterwards.</p>\n<h2>Paltos</h2>\n<p>Sure enough, the Valiant sits at the dock at Paltos, the desolate “backwoods” of the Kieran Empire. The crew of the ship can be found living it up at the local pub, the Gaoler’s Due. Mention of the fire mage’s name and a Streetwise roll reveals that Tomas de Orinjo has been arrested by the Governor of Paltos. The crew is quite unhappy about this—de Orinjo was their friend—and might have fought the Kieran soldiers if they’d not been told to stand down by their captain.</p>\n<p>Tomas was seized along with his belongings. If asked, one of the sailors reports that Tomas was the owner of a small, tear-shaped jewel he wore around his neck. No one knew it was magical however, and as far as they know it is still on his person.</p>\n<p>The Paltos Senator has a secret arrangement with Torquemada, who operates out of the nearby Gray Isles. Torquemada pays the Senator and the warden of the prison to deliver any captured archmages. The warden saw an opportunity to make a few extra silvers when De Orinjo came to town and had him imprisoned on false charges.</p>\n<p>The captain of the Valiant is Quintas Quin, a masaquani from Kiera. He’s furious about the false charges, but can do little about the situation or the senator might have his ship confiscated.</p>\n<h2>The Men of the Valiant</h2>\n<p>Allow any characters who speak to the sailors of the Valiant a Streetwise roll at –2. Those who make it are certain some of the crew might be persuaded to take part in a raid on the prison to free Orinjo. If asked, the leader of the men, a human from England named Dave O’Shanks, says that he and a few of his most loyal mates would be happy to break Orinjo free—the mage has saved their lives on more than one occasion and they want to repay the favor.</p>\n<p>O’Shanks agrees to help as long as the raid takes place after dark. He and his men will wear masks so that they cannot be recognized. They’ve got willing girlfriends who will later attest they spent the night with them should they be accused. That might not matter if the senator decides to arrest them anyway, but it’s a chance they’re willing to take on behalf of their companion.</p>\n<p>O’Shanks knows something about the prison—he served a brief stint there a few years back. The building is a square fortress atop the sea-cliffs east of the city. A single winding road leads up the cliff face, and it is well guarded and protected by two cannon. There are 40+ guards on duty at all times, armed with chain shirts, muskets, and swords. About a dozen man the walls at any given time with half of those stationed at the front gate.</p>\n<h2>Jailbreak</h2>\n<p>O’Shanks shows up at the appointed rendezvous point right on time with a dozen men. (Use typical Privateer statistics.) If the player characters don’t suggest it, O’Shanks recommends climbing the cliff face and taking the guards from behind. His men have brought ropes and cloth-covered hammers (to reduce noise) for this purpose. If this approach is used, the pirates don’t have to make Climbing rolls. If anyone ascends without rope and spikes, however, they must make a Climbing roll at –2 to scale the 60’ cliff.</p>\n<p>Once at the top of the cliff, the group must then get inside the prison walls. This requires one more Climbing roll (a group roll for the crew), as well as a Stealth roll at –2. If the Stealth roll is blown, the guards become Active and 1d4 of them come to investigate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Guards (50):</span> Use City Watch statistics for the guards (p. 184). Ten are on duty at any given time in the courtyard, while two stand guard inside the prison proper. The rest of the guards remain inside the barracks. These men are diligent but not suicidal. They fight on until it’s obviously hopeless.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Captain:</span> Use a City Watch Wild Card for the night captain’s statistics (p. 184).</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Booty:</span> Don’t use the usual Loot for the guards—they carry no treasure on them while on duty. If the party takes time to search the prison offices however, they find a few small works of art and petty cash (Pillage).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alarm</h2>\n<p>The bell tower at the rear of the prison almost certainly sounds once the attack begins unless the heroes scout it out and develop a plan to silence the guard there. Once sounded, the town guard from Paltos responds as well. A force of at least 30 men (Town Militia, p. 185) move up the road. A Kieran Cutter also responds to sink any “getaway” boats.</p>\n<h2>Prisoners</h2>\n<p>The head guard in each prison building has the keys to the cells. Each cell can be opened individually and holds 1d8 prisoners. Freed prisoners fight the guards if armed or run for their lives otherwise.</p>\n<p>The mages are in the rear dungeon, chained to the wall (the only way they can be kept from casting spells). The guard’s key opens their manacles as well. There are two other wizards held prisoner besides Orinjo—Kylie Kirrow, a masaquani water mage, and a near-dead kraken named Grikk. Kylie is young, raven-haired, and attractive—a perfect romantic interest for one of the characters. Grikk is useless until immersed in water. Once that’s done, he heads for the bay as quickly as possible—he was on a quest to obtain a rare medicine for his son when he was intercepted.</p>\n<h2>Other Methods</h2>\n<p>The party may try other methods to free Orinjo, but it will be difficult. The warden might accept a bribe of at least 10,000 pieces of eight— twice what he was expecting from Torquemada. The guards are much cheaper—a minimum of 2500 pieces of eight—but can only ignore the escape, not facilitate it. Petitions, favors, and the like aren’t likely to work either unless a hero has very powerful friends in the Kieran government.</p>\n<p>Orinjo is happy to see his mates and break free. The moment his hands are unbound, he strolls into the courtyard and begins blasting any remaining guards with bolts of fire. His temper is legendary, and he proves to the assembled rescuers just why so many fear fire mages. Assume the battle is won for now once Tomas begins his pyrotechnics.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_slwk1t4xhcl","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Savage Tales","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"rKPiCQNSPMP0Upo8","name":"The Black Prince","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">The Black Prince</h1>\n<p>This adventure can be run in place of any encounter at sea.</p>\n<p>Night falls and a heavy fog rises, forcing the heroes’ ship to slow to a crawl. Even the powerful storm lanterns do little to illuminate the murky gloom. The thick fog muffles the sound of the ship carving through the dark water, and only the faint creaking of timbers breaks the eerie silence.</p>\n<p>Read the following when one or more characters are on watch—preferably when they are alone.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>Although the night is far from warm, you feel the air around you grow noticeably colder. The sudden chill causes you to shiver involuntarily. The hairs on the back of your neck rise and you get the distinct feeling someone is standing behind you—someone who wasn’t there a few seconds ago. A faint whiff of decay reaches your nostrils, causing you to gag.</p>\n</aside>\n</section>\n<p>If the character tries to ignore the strange sensations, the feeling of unease grows steadily stronger. Eventually one of the crew happens by and screams out, pointing behind the character.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>Standing an arm’s length behind you is a ghastly figure who glows with a cold, pale blue light. It is dressed in the fashion of a Spanish naval captain from the late 18th century, though his clothes appear ragged and worn. Maggots crawl through grisly wounds in its rotting flesh. With a ghastly moan, the figure raises its arm and points at you.</p>\n<p>“I need you,” it hisses in broken English. “You must help me.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>Seeing the ghostly Spaniard calls for a Fear check. Attacking the figure is futile—weapons pass straight through without effect. No matter what the heroes do, the figure just stands on the deck, pointing at the nearest character. Seeing as the ghost makes no threatening gestures, and no doubt wishing it gone, striking a conversation should seem a sensible course of action.</p>\n<h2>The Ghost’s Tale</h2>\n<p>Assuming the party converses with the spirit, it tells its sorrowful tale:</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“My name is Captain Iago Alfonso de Toledo,” he says, his voice resonating in the still air. “I was captain of the Black Prince, a Spanish galleon brought into this world three years ago. My ship arrived in the midst of a terrible storm and floundered. The crew abandoned ship and set out in the longboats. A higher authority had already sealed our fate, for we found no land and one by one my crew died of thirst. Rather than suffer, I threw myself overboard and drowned.</p>\n<p>“Since that day I have wandered as a spirit, unable to find peace. In order to depart to whatever fate awaits me, I must have the locket my wife gave me. Without it I am lost, trapped between existences.</p>\n<p>“I cannot journey beneath the waves, but I can aid you in reaching my ship. She lies a day’s sail from here, on a shelf 20 fathoms deep. Aid me and the treasures my ship carried are yours for the taking.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>Captain Iago seems sincere, but hides a terrible secret—when his vessel sank it was carrying slaves to the Americas. No attempt was made to rescue the slaves, and Iago was cursed to wander Caribdus as a ghost until he found someone to aid him.</p>\n<h2>Reaching the Wreck</h2>\n<p>As Iago stated, the wreck of his ship lies a day’s sail from the party’s present location. Iago can pinpoint its location with supernatural accuracy.</p>\n<p>The wreck lies in 20 fathoms of water, on the bottom of a shelf. Getting down to the wreck without the use of the environmental protection power is next to impossible. Luckily, Iago can imbue characters with the power simply by touching them. Unfortunately, he cannot extend the duration beyond an hour. Travel to and from the wreck takes a total of 20 minutes, leaving the group 40 minutes to explore.</p>\n<p>Although the power lets heroes move at their full Pace, armor still subtracts its protection value from Swimming rolls underwater. Leather armor also weighs twice as much when wet (which may affect encumbrance totals).</p>\n<p>As the characters make their descent, have them make sight based Notice rolls. Those who succeed spot maneater sharks (one per 2 heroes), darting toward the group out of the murky depths.</p>\n<p> Maneater Sharks (1 per 2 Heroes): p. 200.</p>\n<h2>The Black Prince</h2>\n<p>The ship suffered badly during the storm—the bow has shattered, its timbers dispersed over a wide area, leaving only the stern remaining. Rusty cannons and cannonballs lie in the silt where they fell. Entrance to the ship can be gained through the mid-section, which lies open. The name of the ship is no longer visible. Aside from the following areas, there is nothing of value on the vessel.</p>\n<p>Hold: Within the hold are the remains of 30 slaves, each manacled to the wall by a heavy chain. One of the skeletons is considerably larger than the others—this is the remains of Benga Mamoto’s brother, Machawi.</p>\n<p> Booty: Benga rewards the group with a charm bracelet if the skeleton is returned to him. The bracelet protects the wearer from evil spirits and grants +2 Armor against supernatural or magical attacks.</p>\n<p>Iago’s Cabin: Much of the furnishings remain, including the captain’s tarred sea chest. The corpses of several crewmembers lie on the floor, their tattered flesh food for numerous fishes.</p>\n<p> Zombies (1 per Hero): p. 203.</p>\n<p> Booty: The chest contains charts and papers, a silver portrait containing a miniature portrait of a dark haired woman, and 500 pieces of eight.</p>\n<p>Opening the chest underwater ruins the captain’s charts and papers. If kept dry, the papers reveal Iago’s business transactions, detailing slave shipments over many years and listing as many as 50% casualties among his cargo on some voyages. The charts are useless, showing the Americas rather than Caribdus, but are worth $200 to a collector such as Jose-Maria Caballeros (page 88).</p>\n<p>If the heroes try to leave with the locket—in or out of the chest—the corpses animate as zombies. Iago’s crew, subjected to the torment of being undead, has no wish for their captain to find salvation.</p>\n<h2>Redemption</h2>\n<p>Once the heroes return to their ship, Iago rushes up to them, demanding the locket and making all manner of threats if refused. Fortunately for the heroes he cannot harm them (part of his curse), nor can he take the locket by force—it must be given to him freely.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the characters hand over the locket is a personal choice. Iago willfully and knowingly left his “cargo” to die when his ship floundered, thus bringing the curse on himself and his crew.</p>\n<p>If the locket is handed over, Iago clutches it to his chest, thanks the heroes, and vanishes, never to be seen again. Should they refuse, Iago emits an anguished cry and fades from view, vowing revenge in the next life. Iago is tied to his ship but not the locket—a particularly cruel revenge is to sail away and throw the locket overboard at some random point in the journey, forever denying him peace.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_slwk1t4xhcl","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Savage Tales","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"sQwxd7oG3u2NxVnn","name":"Defend the Village","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Defend the Village</h1>\n<p>Finding Cuna woefully lacking in booty, the pirates gave the locals two days to gather food and timber for their return. Unwilling to bow to threats any longer the villagers convened a meeting and decided to seek help from any friendly ship arriving before the pirates return.</p>\n<p>The Harbor Master, Dominic Cooper, informs the party of the situation and pleads for assistance. He asks the heroes to help erect a wooden fence around the village, donate a cannon (with powder and ammunition), and help drive off the pirates in return for as much food and timber as they can spare and free Harbor Master stamps on any cargo they buy here for the next 12 months.</p>\n<p>Building the Wall: Of the 150 or so villagers, half are available to help work on the fence. Unfortunately the village has little prepared timber. In order to build the fence, trees must be felled and cleaned of branches, holes must be dug, and the logs sharpened and embedded in the ground—and all in two days.</p>\n<p>A fence completely surrounding the village requires 600 yards of wall. One character should be nominated as foreman. He must make a Persuasion roll each day—the villagers do not respond well to Intimidation—with a +2 bonus for each Leadership Edge he possesses. Each success and raise gathers 100 yards of sharpened timbers.</p>\n<p>Use the map on page 122 and let the defenders decide where to place the fence sections. The villagers place barrels on their side of the wall as firing platforms.</p>\n<h3>Here They Come!</h3>\n<p>The pirates’ brigantine anchors 90 yards offshore at dawn on the third day. The pirate captain isn’t blind—he sees the newly-erected fence and prepares his cannons accordingly. The range to the fence is 120 yards. If the group has left their ship in the harbor the captain orders his gunners to attack it while the raiding party goes ashore.</p>\n<p>A small fleet of longboats carries the pirates to shore. Once on land, the captain calls on the villagers to surrender or pay the price for disobedience—the total destruction of Cuna. No villager is prepared to negotiate with the pirates leaving a winner-takes-all fight as the only possible outcome.</p>\n<p>The distance between the beach and the fence is 20 yards. Climbing the fence requires a successful Climbing roll and takes an entire round. Firing over the fence provides Heavy Cover (–4).</p>\n<p>If the pirates lose ten men the captain orders a retreat back down the beach to take shelter behind their longboats while signaling his ship to open fire on the palisade. The fence has a Toughness of 11(2). Each wound the cannons cause creates a 2-yard (1 game inch) breach in the wall at a location of the Game Master’s choosing.</p>\n<p>After two volleys of cannon fire the pirates surge forth again, this time continuing the fight until the captain is killed or there are only ten left, at which point they return to their ship and sail away to lick their wounds. They do not return to Cuna again.</p>\n<p>Assuming the heroes have left crew on their ship they can use it to harass the pirates’ vessel. Commanding the pirate vessel is a Veteran Pirate—he has 12 Typical Pirates at his disposal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Villagers (150):</span> Use Citizen stats (p. 184) with Fighting d4.

{"_id":"uMiAoyZLIMEFFICD","name":"Debauchery","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Debauchery</h1>\n<p>Mannie Morkan is a proud citizen of Ograpog who despises the Baltimus’ family for deserting King Amemnus in his hour of need. He has said so in public many times—enough so that Bruno Baltimus secretly invited Morkan’s daughter to one of his after-hours parties. The starstruck 17-year old girl foolishly accepted the invitation. The next morning, Morrie was left dazed and abused on Morkan’s doorstep. The message was clear.</p>\n<h3>Morkan’s Revenge</h3>\n<p>Morkan pretended to back down, but in truth his anger seethes like a boiling teapot. The merchant now seeks an assassin—one with the stomach to slaughter Bruno and his entire group of rakes as they defile themselves at one of their midnight soirées.</p>\n<p>How Morkan learns of the player characters is up to you. They must be of a somewhat tarnished disposition and quite capable to be approached by the mad father. They must also be somewhat charming, for Morkan’s plan is for them to gain Bruno Baltimus’ trust and then betray him.</p>\n<p>When Mannie is finally ready to make his offer, he approaches the crew and drops a piece of paper in their hands. On the paper is a single word— Versalis. A Common Knowledge roll at –2 (–4 to visitors) allows a hero to remember this as a legendary masaquani sword, equivalent to Earth’s Excalibur.</p>\n<p>Assuming the party follows Morkan outside, he says the following:</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“I’m looking for agents of vengeance. Men and women who aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty. Very dirty. I’m looking for curs who can pretend to be a man’s best friend and then gut him from behind when he turns his back. If I can find such hirelings, and if they avenge my family, I will pass on a treasure unlike any they have ever seen.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>Morkan is taking a bit of a risk here—the crew could simply beat him until he revealed the location of Versalis. His daughter, Morrie, watches from a dark corner beyond, but can do little but scream if the crew attempts to attack her father. Even this is a risk because the sailors could reveal what Mannie said to Baltimus, which would almost certainly result in his and his daughter’s death.</p>\n<p>Mannie is desperate now though. He’s sick and knows he won’t live much longer. His daughter cannot wield Versalis, and he has no other living kin to give it to, so this is his final gift to his family. It’s all or nothing.</p>\n<h3>The Mark</h3>\n<p>If the heroes agree to Mannie’s offer, he bows his head, grits his teeth, and says: “Do you know who Bruno Baltimus is?” That should be enough to make most characters think twice about this assignment. Bruno Baltimus is the son of Byron Baltimus, the founder of the city and one of the founders of the Great Harbor system itself. If the group seems undaunted, however, Mannie continues:</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“What the father did to the King of Ograpog was treason. What he did to this city makes my skin crawl. What his son and his rakes did to my daughter makes my blood boil.</p>\n<p>I have forged invitations to Bruno’s next gala in three days. I want you to go to the party and find a way to make him invite you to his after hours debauchery. The one he throws after the other guests leave. While he and his friends defile themselves, I want you to strike. Kill them all. I don’t care if they suffer or not, I just want them dead, dead, DEAD!”</p>\n</section>\n<p>Mannie is visibly shaking by this point. Spit flies from his lips and his skin turns red as a beet. If the crew agrees, Morkan hands over a blank invitation for one person and his “entourage.” The party is to be held three nights from tonight.</p>\n<h3>Baltimus Manor</h3>\n<p>The Manor is a huge marble building on the high cliffs of Baltimus. The gala begins with a feast around dinner time (6 bells) and continues until 11 bells or so. At that point the doors are closed and the staff begins to clean.</p>\n<p>Bruno and a dozen of his closest friends plus twice that number of young women head into the heir’s parlor upstairs, a maze of thin, oriental-style partitions hiding numerous beds, hookahs, liquor, and erotic paintings. A trio of musicians even plays soft and suggestive music from behind one of the walls.</p>\n<p>Getting invited to this soiree requires some serious roleplaying as well as a few key Persuasion rolls. Fellow hunters, nobles, and playboys fit well with Bruno and his band, as do attractive women.</p>\n<p>The activities start with wine and dancing and quickly descend into depravity from there.</p>\n<p>If the player characters are part of the debauchery, they can simply grab their weapons and do as they will. The exterior walls of the room are quite thick, so even gunshots aren’t likely to rouse the estate’s guards as long as the doors remain shut and the large window overhead remains intact.</p>\n<p>Bruno tries to fight at first, but as soon as he realizes he’s outnumbered he rallies behind some of his surviving rakes, then suddenly abandons them and leaps for the staircase yelling “Guards!” A dozen guards arrive wherever Bruno is 1d6 rounds after they hear his yell.</p>\n<p>If the assassins weren’t invited to the party, they’ll need to break in somehow, perhaps posing as servants or simply sneaking through the house somehow.</p>\n<p>Bruno has five guards posted inside the house, and another dozen circle the grounds outside.</p>\n<p>Guards (17): Use veteran City Watch (p. 184) for the 17 guards stationed around the manor.</p>\n<p>Rakes (13): Bruno and his twelve friends are athletic outdoorsmen. Use City Watch statistics (p. 184) for the lecherous nobles. Bruno is a Wild Card.</p>\n<p>Booty: The heroes have just enough time to gather a King’s Ransom.</p>\n<h3>Aftermath</h3>\n<p>What happens next depends on the assassins’ actions. The British East India Company puts out a $10,000 bounty on the killers. Everywhere the group goes, they are hunted and hounded. Even after they leave Baltimus, they are likely to be found as news of the deed spreads around Caribdus. Both good souls and greedy ones partake in the chase, hoping to bring these foul killers to justice—and collect the reward.</p>\n<p>Byron’s Diary: If the heroes are here to find Byron’s diary, they do so after slaying Bruno. If they try to talk him into giving them his father’s records, he agrees if convinced that it will save the world (a Persuasion roll at –2).</p>\n<p>Versalis: Mannie Morkan lives up to his promise. He meets the group at their preappointed spot and gives them Versalis, one of the most powerful swords in Caribdus.</p>\n<p>Versalis: Anytime the wielder of Versalis hits with a raise, the foe must make a Vigor roll at –2 or be beheaded and die instantly. The magic works on any living creature of Size –2 to +2 that has a discernible head.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_slwk1t4xhcl","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Savage Tales","color":"#000000"},"journal-backlinks":{"references":{}}}}

{"_id":"uSYbNNrWZ5wEJo7r","name":"The Money Pit","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">The Money Pit</h1>\n<p>Owen McDougal is the town drunk and known locally for his tall tales of buried treasure. None of the locals take him seriously, but he earns a few pieces of eight keeping them entertained on stormy nights. While the group is in town a storm strikes, forcing the characters to take shelter in one of the larger shacks. Owen is present in the small crowd of locals sheltering in the same accommodation. As the storm reaches its height Owen begins his tale.</p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“Arrr, ’twas four years ago this very day I came across the strange pit in the woods east of here. Perhaps I wouldn’t have even noticed it, all covered in fallen branches as it were, if I hadn’t been drinking and stumbled inta the hole. As I lay on me back I gazed up and there, swaying in the trees was an old block and tackle.</p>\n<p>“Naturally, I thought to meself I’d found some buried treasure. I got meself a pick and shovel and went back the next day to begin digging. Two feet down I hit stone. These weren’t no ordinary stones but flagstones, all square and proper like. Beneath was a filled-in shaft with signs of pick marks on the edge—surely the work of pirates burying their loot!</p>\n<p>“I kept on digging ‘til at ten feet I hit wood. Sadly ’twas no chest but a layer of planks laid across the pit. Sensing gold lay just beneath I carried on but after 25 feet I was beaten. ’T’would need a crew of men to carry on digging.</p>\n<p>“You all remember how I came back all excited and like don’t yer? And none of you would take me seriously! Well, I tried digging further meself but ’twas no use. It wasn’t a job for one man so I filled in the hole and gave up. It’s still there now, all that treasure, just waiting to be dug up.”</p>\n</aside>\n<p>McDougal’s tale is well-known to the locals. Many of them have seen the site of his excavation but there is no proof buried treasure exists and the locals lack the skill and equipment—as well as the inclination—to follow up the matter.</p>\n<p>Excavating the pit from the surface is no easy task. It extends for 80 feet with planks of wood sealed with clay and coconut fiber every ten to fifteen feet beneath the 25 feet mark. Worse still, breaching a wooden layer at 60 feet causes the pit to flood. No matter how fast the group bails the water keeps refilling. There is no way to prevent the shaft flooding—even magic fails to stem the flow. A clue to how to reach the treasure lies in the water, however—it is seawater.</p>\n<p>The bottom of the shaft is located in the ceiling of one of the numerous sea caverns located beneath the island. This particular cavern is lower than those around it and has numerous water channels feeding it from above and the sides. In effect, the bottom of the shaft is below sea level.</p>\n<p>Locating the correct cavern requires the characters to swim in the bloodfish-infested caverns. Every character may make a Smarts (–4) roll for each 30 minutes spent searching. The character scoring the highest success spots the shaft extending upward from the cavern roof. Each roll, successful or not, brings the characters into contact with one or more swarms of bloodfish.</p>\n<p>The treasure is located on a series of tarred wooden planks 10 feet up the shaft. Note thatSavage Tales 157 the planks, while protected from rot, are not joined together—water can get through with ease. Reaching it requires the character to break one or more planks, causing the treasure to fall into the cavern.</p>\n<p>Salvaging the treasure in this method takes four hours less one hour per success and raise on a Swimming roll (to a minimum of one hour). Again, each roll requires the characters to deal with hungry bloodfish.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_4s6bxi84dvu","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Savage Tales#/CF_SEP/The Dragonshards","color":"#000000"}}}

Once the ship draws closer, a lone crewman lying in the bottom of the boat becomes clearly noticeable. Judging by his appearance he has been at sea for several days. He is also unconscious. Tucked into his waterlogged jacket are two pistols (no shot or powder), 50 pieces of eight, and an empty water flask.</p>\n<p>If brought aboard and given fresh water, the man quickly recovers some of his strength. Once awake, he thanks the captain for his good deed.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“I never thought I’d see another ship,” he says weakly, shaking you by the hand. “My name is James Low, an Englishmen by birth and former mate on the merchantman Trinidad.

Most of the crew died, but a few of us were taken prisoner.</p>\n<p>“More out of fear than bravery I insulted their captain, calling him names not fit to repeat in polite company. Rather than kill me, he set me adrift in the ship’s dinghy. More by luck than judgment, I was carrying a flask of water about my person and the fools never searched me.</p>\n<p>“I was given two pistols, both empty. I guess the captain thought I’d take the easy option if he gave me a loaded gun and having them present but useless would drive me mad. Your finding me was a miracle.</p>\n<p>“But pray tell me, where are we? I know only a little navigation but the stars here do not look right for the latitude.”</p>\n</aside>\n</section>\n<p>After learning all he can about Caribdus, Low feigns fatigue, asking to be left alone in order to recover from his ordeal. Before the captain leaves, Low offers him 50 pieces of silver to be taken to the nearest civilized port.</p>\n<p>Low has good reason not to elaborate on his tale—he is actually Edward Low, one of the cruelest pirates to sail the seas of Earth and pirates did not attack his ship.</p>\n<p>Low’s cruelty and love of violence was legendary. His favorite act was removing various bits of his victim’s faces and forcing them to eat them. Even Low’s crew eventually tired of his violence and cast him adrift in a dinghy with few provisions. The following day, the little boat drifted into a fog bank and vanished from the face of the Earth.</p>\n<p>If a deal is struck, Low happily pays the heroes in advance.

Grok is a reedy half-orc who favors dark clothing. She carries a notched greataxe and an array of throwing axes hangs from her belt. Grok frequently grins toothily, and uses appalling curse words, particularly when drunk.

Recovering a PC’s starting equipment is considered simple aid (DC +0), a loan of goods worth up to 150 gp is considered lengthy aid (DC +5), and a loan of 300 gp worth of equipment is considered dangerous aid that could result in punishment, since she might get keelhauled herself for theft (DC +15).</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":4,"type":"base","role":"Quartermaster","location":"The Wormwood","race":"Female Half-Orc","gender":"","age":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":"","profession":"","voice":"Gravelly","faction":"","height":"","weight":"","traits":"","ideals":"","bonds":"","flaws":"","longterm":"","shortterm":"","beliefs":"","secret":"","DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":{"notes":""},"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_rxb9n4yk7i","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Season 1: Mutiny Against the Cloudreavers#/CF_SEP/The Storm Reaver#/CF_SEP/Crew of the Storm Reaver","color":"#000000"},"_document-sheet-registrar":{"type":"base"}}}
