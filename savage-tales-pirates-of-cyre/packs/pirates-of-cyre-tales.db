{"name":"Day 1: A Keelhauling","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Day 1: A Keelhauling</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The PCs wake up the following morning in the dark hold of the Wormwood (area A10). They all remember the night before—the ringing laughter of a wild night, the heady joy of excess, the scents of rich stewed meat and perfume lingering in their nostrils. Then describe the sensations that the PCs feel—a pounding headache, the sickly taste of cheap wine in their mouths, the hard f loor, a rhythmic creaking noise, and the feeling of the room swaying, as if they were still drunk. Before the PCs can do much more than sit up, however, several pairs of heavy footsteps enter the dark room, and the harsh light of a lantern painfully spears the PCs’ eyes.</p>\n<p>Creatures: Master Scourge, the Wormwood’s boatswain, master-at-arms, and infamous disciplinarian, has entered the hold to wake the PCs and get them up to the main deck. Six rough-looking Wormwood pirates, armed with saps, accompany him. An expression that might be mistaken for pain but which is clearly an attempt at a smile bruises Scourge’s face as he cracks the whip in his hand and screams at the PCs.</p>\n<section class=\"readaloud\">\n<p>“Still abed with the sun over the yardarm? On your feet, ye filthy swabs! Get up on deck and report for duty before Cap’n Harrigan flays your flesh into sausage skins and has Fishguts fry ye up for breakfast!”</p>\n</section>\n<p>The PCs quickly discover that most, if not all, of their weapons and equipment are gone (see below). If the PCs refuse, even momentarily, to accompany Scourge, he lashes out at any offending PCs with his whip. If necessary, he calls for aid from the pirates, who attack uncooperative characters with their saps. It should be immediately clear to the PCs that if they don’t cooperate, they will quickly be overpowered. Scourge and the pirates herd the PCs up through the middle deck (area A6) and onto the Wormwood’s main deck (area A3) to meet the ship’s captain.</p>\n<p>As the PCs make their way to the main deck, they can begin to adjust to their surroundings and deduce what happened to them. A DC 10 Perception check discerns the aftertaste of oily nutmeg on the tongue. A DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check or DC 10 Knowledge (nature) check recognizes this as a clear sign of oil of taggit poisoning (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 560). Each PC remembers indulging in either spicy food or spicy rum late last night, and those who made the above checks realize that the oil was likely added to their food or drink, and the Master Scourge spices hid the taste of the taggit oil. Any PCs who make a DC 10 Intelligence check remember seeing the face of Master Scourge last night as well, and can piece together the facts outlined above.</p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> If the PCs decide to fight, Master Scourge and the pirates attack, attempting to disarm the PCs of any weapons they might have concealed and subdue them with nonlethal damage. The pirates will not the kill the PCs, however. Once the pirates have the upper hand (with the help of additional crew, if necessary), they take the PCs—conscious or unconscious—to the main deck, where they get an immediate taste of punishment on the Wormwood. The PCs are tied to the mainmast, and Master Scourge gives each of them three lashes before the captain’s address. See “The Life of a Pirate” on page 60 for details of punishments on a pirate ship.</p>\n<h2>Meeting the Captain</h2>\n<p>When the PCs reach the main deck, either of their own volition or under duress, it’s quickly apparent that they are on a sizable ship in the middle of the ocean, far from any land. Port Peril and the mainland of the Shackles are just an ochre haze many miles astern. Figures cluster around the ship’s mainmast, looking up at the higher deck on the stern, where two figures stand. One of them is a broad, muscular Garundi man with a shaven head, a long beard bound with gold rings, and an eye patch— clearly the captain. The other is a younger, balding man with a long black ponytail, wearing a long coat and carrying a well-used cat-o’-nine-tails.</p>\n<p>At this point the PCs also notice that they are not the only new recruits—four others are standing with them on the deck, set apart by their relative cleanliness and their apparent unease with their newfound situation. A dozen or so other pirates, clearly existing members of the crew, stand about on the deck or in the ship’s rigging. Once the PCs are on deck, the captain addresses the crew.</p>\n<section class=\"readaloud\">\n<p>“Glad you could join us at last! Welcome to the Wormwood! My thanks for ‘volunteering’ to join my crew. I’m Barnabas Harrigan. That’s Captain Barnabas Harrigan to you, not that you’ll ever need to address me. I have only one rule—don’t speak to me. I like talk, but I don’t like your talk. Follow that rule and we’ll all get along fine.</p>\n<p>“Oh, and one more thing. Even with you new recruits, we’re still short-handed, and I aim to keep what crew I have. There’ll be a keelhaulin’ for anyone caught killin’ anyone. Mr. Plugg! If you’d be so kind as to make pirates out of these landlubbers, it’ll save me having to put them in the sweatbox for a year and a day before I make pies out of ’em.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>At the end of his speech, the captain walks away, leaving behind the man with the cat-o’-nine-tails. This is Mister Plugg, the Wormwood’s first mate. He looks down at the PCs and other impressed captives and smiles unpleasantly. Plugg has no time for small talk or pleasantries. His intention is to get the new recruits working on the ship as soon as possible. He immediately begins his own unique and cunning evaluations to test the PCs’ abilities. Mr. Plugg is introduced on page 20.</p>\n<h2>Mr. Plugg's Tests</h2>\n<p>After Harrigan’s recent difficulties, the Wormwood is seriously undermanned, and Mr. Plugg has a number of positions to fill on the ship. Whether or not the PCs are ideal candidates does not concern him in the slightest, as he assigns jobs first, then worries about making the PCs fit their roles afterward. Plugg is not remotely interested in who the PCs believe is best, or whether, for example, the best climber makes a couple of bad rolls and loses out to a lucky non-climber. The PCs can deliberately try to fail a test, however, by making a Bluff check opposed by Plugg’s Sense Motive skill to get away with it. If the check fails, Plugg smells a rat and immediately gives that PC three lashes with the cat (see page 66) as punishment.</p>\n<p>Plugg’s first test is to see how good the PCs are at climbing, as he needs another sailor to work in the rigging. He instructs the PCs to climb to the crow’s nest on the mainmast above the main deck as fast as they can, coldly cursing them if they hesitate, and cruelly taunting them if they fall. Climbing the rigging requires a DC 10 Climb check to reach the crow’s nest, 60 feet above the deck. Remember that the PCs climb at one-quarter their normal speeds (or half speed with an accelerated climb) so each PC will need to make several Climb checks. The first PC to reach the crow’s nest is the winner. In the event of a tie, the PC with the highest final Climb check is the winner. PCs who refuse the test are whipped by Scourge until they climb. The PC who wins this test is told that he or she is now a rigger, and works directly for Plugg, who assigns that PC the first day’s duties at the conclusion of the second test.</p>\n<p>Plugg’s second test is one of necessity—he knows the ship’s cook, Ambrose “Fishguts” Kroop, has a drinking problem, and he’s fed up with eating rubbish. This test is simple: Plugg asks each PC in turn whether they can cook, and if one of them says yes, that PC becomes the new cook’s mate. If Plugg gets to the end of the line without an affirmative answer, he simply picks the fattest PC (Plugg assumes that character likes food the most) and says, “You’re a cook’s mate now,” and tells that PC to report to Ambrose Kroop in the galley (area A8). If more than one person claims to be a good cook, Plugg picks the fattest.</p>\n<p>The remaining PCs are all assigned to be swabs, under the command of Master Scourge, who immediately gets them working. See A Pirate’s Day on page 22 for details on the tasks associated with the PCs’ new jobs. For the cook’s mate, see page 21 for details on that PC’s first meeting with Ambrose Kroop.</p>\n<h2>A Keelhauling</h2>\n<p><strong>Work:</strong> The PCs spend the day at their assigned jobs. In addition, each PC can take a single daytime ship action.</p>\n<p><strong>“Bloody Hour”:</strong> The crew gathers on deck at dusk to witness the keelhauling of Jakes Magpie, a pirate caught stealing from the quartermaster’s store the night before. After a brief interrogation at the hands of Mr. Plugg and Master Scourge, Jakes admitted his crime, and is now brought up from the bilges (area A11) to be slowly keelhauled before the evening meal. A DC 15 Perception check notices the relish with which Mr. Plugg, in particular, tugs at the rope as the unfortunate Magpie is dragged under the ship for 12 rounds. What appears on the other side has been cut to shreds and is soon thrown overboard to feed the sharks. A PC who examines the body before it is dumped can make a DC 15 Heal check to estimate that the unfortunate Jakes took about 24 points of damage from the punishment and drowned as well. Witnessing Jakes’s keelhauling should help impress upon the players the deadly nature of pirate punishments.</p>\n<p><strong>Leisure:</strong> After dinner and the rum rations, various pirate entertainments (see page 67) take place on deck or below, for as long as people are sober enough to participate. In addition, each PC can take a single nighttime ship action.</p>\n<p><strong>Rest:</strong> Provided they’ve drunk their rum rations, the PCs can retire to their hammocks in the lower hold (area A10) whenever they wish. The PCs can take additional nighttime ship actions if they have the energy</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{},"cf":{"id":"temp_h3063nyd2jt","path":"Pirates of Cyre#/CF_SEP/1.

Rockface now thinks as little of Kragshard as he does a bilge rat, but he’s not yet killed the cook because drunk as he is, Kragshard is still a better cook than anyone else on the Wormwood, and the captain is partial to his cooking.</p>\n<p>Kragshard’s days begin with blearily handing out ship’s biscuits to the crew on deck before retiring to the galley to prepare the evening meal (almost always fish stew) in a big pot. Then he cozies up with a bottle of rum (sometimes mixed with raw eggs) and waits for the rest of the day to pass. Nevertheless, Kragshard is a skilled chef, though few of the crew beyond the captain and his officers ever get the chance to sample Kragshard’s more palatable fare.</p>\n<p>His only joy, aside from drinking and swapping yarns with Grok, are his chickens. Kragshard loves his poultry and collects any rare breeds he comes across. Anyone with a background in farming finds Kragshard friendly, while those who truly know their birds quickly discover a helpful friend. Kragshard’s favorite bird, a large black cockerel named Black-Hearted Bezebel, often perches on the cook’s shoulder and even talks to him, or so Kragshard occasionally drunkenly claims.</p>\n<h3>Appearance</h3>\n<p>Kragshard is a large, some would say fat, man, weighing well over 200 pounds and standing only 5 feet tall. He exudes an air of neglect, perhaps even despair, from the bushy tufts of black hair behind his ears, to his rotting teeth, to the stains on his filthy apron. He walks with a wallowing waddle, particularly when drunk, but is capable of surprising acts of strength. Kragshard talks with a thick Shackles accent, which some people find hard to follow. He’s had so many lashes that his back is like tanned leather, and he claims to not even feel the bite of the lash anymore. After 44 years in the school of hard knocks, Kragshard is a man who clearly cares little for himself or what people think of him. Nevertheless, he is at heart a kind man, and does his best to protect his cook’s mate from punishments brought on by mistakes made by either of them.</p>\n<h3>Gossip</h3>\n<p>The PCs can learn the following about Kragshard with successful Diplomacy checks to gather information.</p>\n<p>DC 5: “Fishguts” might once have been a famous chef at that fancy place in Port Peril, but now all he cooks is fishgut stew. He’s so pickled in rum now, bilgewater is all he can make.</p>\n<p>DC 10: Remember the last cook’s mate? Nobody does—only when he disappeared. Just up and vanished, that one, like he was spirited away, or maybe dropped in a pot...</p>\n<p>DC 15: Kragshard was so drunk once that he bet his life in a game with the captain, and now he’s little more than Rockface’s slave.</p>\n<h3>CampaiGn Role</h3>\n<p>Krornik Kragshard begins the adventure as a cynical, washed up drunk who is insensibly intoxicated half of the time, dreaming of a better life. However, he is also an obvious potential friend and ally of the PCs, as he loathes the captain and crew of the Wormwood and longs for a chance to escape. Kragshard makes an excellent NPC to plant the idea of mutiny in the PCs’ minds. He is not a risktaker, however, and can, like Sandara Quinn (see page 56), act as a voice of reason as the PCs plan their actions. If the PCs manage to befriend Kragshard, he can become a useful ally for the PCs in the future. Besides being a fine cook, he has handy communication skills and can also help out in a fight if needed. Kragshard has also plied his trade in the Shackles throughout his life and has an excellent knowledge of the region and its perils, personalities, and possibilities.</p>\n<p>As the adventure progresses, Kragshard’s interactions with the PCs begin to give his life purpose, to the extent that by the time the PCs move to the Man’s Promise in Part Two, he begins drinking much less. Away from the sour atmosphere of the Wormwood, Kragshard’s spirits lighten, and he is only drunk 1 day in every four. When the PCs finally mutiny, Kragshard is sober for the event, and aids the PCs as best he can. If the mutiny is successful, Kragshard announces that his new friends have inspired him to turn over a new leaf. If the PCs are cutthroats, Kragshard throws his lot in with them to begin a new life. If they are kindhearted dandies, Kragshard sees in them a more honorable way of life. Regardless, he offers his services as ship’s cook to the PCs. His lapses into drinking become less frequent—he is now drunk only 1 day in every week—and continue to be so throughout the rest of the Adventure Path.</p>\n<p>It is unlikely that the PCs will make an enemy of Kragshard, but should they do so, he gladly assists anyone who wants to kill the PCs. Having had a taste of possible freedom, he wants to punish those who let him taste it before he crawls back into the bottom of a rum bottle to die.</p>\n</div>","img":"modules/monks-enhanced-journal/assets/person.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_d2s7uhtlcf","path":"Pirates of Cyre#/CF_SEP/The Wormwood#/CF_SEP/1.1.

{"name":"Master Scourge","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<p>Master Scourge is the Wormwood’s boatswain and masterat-arms, and Mr. Dabrak’s right-hand man. As boatswain, he is in charge of all activities and sailors on deck, and as master-at-arms, he is responsible for discipline. Master Scourge is a sneering man with a braided beard and a mouth full of gold teeth. His body is tall and thin, and even his long coat and heavy boots fail to give any impression of strength or bulk. A sadistic coward, Scourge uses his association with Dabrak as protection and in return has no morals when it comes to the tasks his master sets. He is bold and violent when the odds are stacked in his favor, happily kicking a dying dog in the street if asked to do so. But should that dog get up and bite, he quickly f lees.</p>\n<p>Master Scourge is a key villain in the early part of the adventure, and his whispered words further poison Mr. Dabrak against the PCs. Scourge’s relationship with the PCs is a crucial one. He immediately senses something out of the ordinary about them, and his dreams of rank and fortune soon begin to unravel. Like most bullies, Scourge is a coward at heart, and sets out to discredit and ultimately kill his rivals.</p>\n<p>This enmity is personal, and primarily directed at a single PC, though how this manifests is ultimately up to you. Scourge was recently rejected by Sandara Quinn (see page 56), and any object of her affections is sure to earn his jealousy and hatred. Likewise, Scourge might be jealous of a handsome and talented PC and fear for his own position on the ship. While Scourge focuses his hostility on one PC, he is also happy to intimidate and victimize the other PCs, as well as seeking to discredit the PCs’ friends. He avoids the PCs as a group, however, and immediately goes to Dabrak’s side if threatened. If actually attacked, he also goes to Dabrak, who may have the PCs disciplined.</p>\n<p>Playing the bully requires you to temper the PCs’ anger while ensuring they recognize Scourge as a deadly enemy with far too many allies to simply be killed. Terrified as he is of Harrigan and having no desire to be keelhauled, Scourge won’t try to kill the PCs—at least, not at first. Instead, he seeks to poison the other crew members against the PCs, and is likely to succeed with his own small band of admirers, whom the PCs will find hard to convert. In essence, this group becomes a rival adventuring party, but with one crucial difference: these rivals also enjoy the support of Mr. Dabrak. It’s not until events move on to the Man’s Promise in Part Two that Dabrak and Scourge decide to have done with the PCs, but they’ll eventually get their comeuppance at the hands of the PCs in Part Three.</p>\n</div>","img":"modules/monks-enhanced-journal/assets/person.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_d2s7uhtlcf","path":"Pirates of Cyre#/CF_SEP/The Wormwood#/CF_SEP/1.1.

{"name":"Mister Dabrak","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<p>Mister Dabrak is an angry young woman. He’s always furious about something, but somehow her rage simmers like a stew, and even when she loses her temper she quickly seems to gain control again. A sadist and bully, Dabrak has had a hard, desperate life—few places are more dangerous to grow up than the dockside streets of the Shackles. Only 21 years of age, the memories and scars of Dabrak’s formative years are very fresh, and now she intends to have her revenge.</p>\n<p>Dabrak is also incredibly ambitious—he intends to captain her own ship someday, and she joined the crew of the Wormwood purely for her own ends. Thanks to her ruthless devotion to Captain Rockface’s orders, her rise has been meteoric. In just 11 months aboard the Wormwood, she has wormed, blackmailed, and murdered her way to the position of first mate, in truth a job well beyond her abilities. she masks her own inadequacies by pointing out those of others.</p>\n<p>Everyone on board the Wormwood knows that the first mate is the captain’s right hand when it comes to dealing with the ship’s crew, but Harrigan’s other officers form a close inner circle that Dabrak can’t seem to penetrate, a fact that vexes him to no end. Nevertheless, Harrigan is sure to punish anyone who attacks Dabrak, a fact that every member of the crew is acutely aware of.</p>\n<p>To Mister Dabrak, honor, friendship, and teamwork are alien concepts. she believes that discipline is the only thing that matters at sea, and that the constant threat of ruthless punishment is the only thing that can keep a crew of cutthroats and scoundrels in line. she strikes first, and asks questions later. Dabrak is not a forgiving woman, and if someone does get the better of him, Dabrak takes time to plot her revenge in the cruelest way she can think of.</p>\n<p>Bald except for a black ponytail and sporting long, narrow beard, Mister Dabrak somehow looks angry, miserable, and uncomfortable, all at the same time. Bare-chested, she wears an immaculate coat with pearl buttons and carries a cat-o’-nine-tails with him at all times. she clearly takes great pride in himself—everything about him shines, from the polish on her boots to the dome of her head. her teeth are gray and yellow, however, and her face is fixed in an almost constant grimace.</p>\n<h2>Gossip</h2>\n<p>The PCs can learn the following about Mister Dabrak with successful Diplomacy checks to gather information.</p>\n<p>DC 5: If Scourge is a bastard, then Mister Dabrak is her mother and father. One piece of advice—do as she says.</p>\n<p>DC 10: First mate? He’s barely been on board a year! The apple of the captain’s eye, that one. Harrigan treats him like a son—but not a legitimate one, of course.</p>\n<p>DC 15: That cutlass of her is magical, see, no doubt about that, and she wields that cat like it was her own arm. I’ve seen him using both in combat. Despite her pettish looks, he’s some fighter by all accounts.</p>\n<p>DC 20: People who cross Dabrak end up dead—stabbed, poisoned, throttled, thrown overboard. Take your pick, they always end up dead. she has friends everywhere, high and low.</p>\n<h2>CampaiGn Role</h2>\n<p>Mister Dabrak (and to a similar extent her repulsive sidekick Master Scourge) presents a challenge for you as GM. she is the main villain of the adventure, yet at the beginning she has considerable inf luence and is practically unassailable. The challenge is to make the PCs loathe him without pushing them to openly attack him, an act that results in keelhauling.</p>\n<p>The penalty for murder on the Wormwood should be enough to keep a lid on your player’s desires, but be careful not to overuse her bullying. Dabrak oversees the punishments for infractions on the ship, and does so with relish, but it is Master Scourge, her toadying subordinate, who actually carries out most of the disciplining and poisons the first mate’s mind against the PCs. Again, be careful not to overplay the bullying and sadism, but make sure it is prevalent. With care, you can develop a brooding hatred in your players for this nasty piece of work, and they’ll relish their final encounter with him when the chance eventually presents itself.</p>\n<p>If your players are more unequivocal, however, and likely to bring things to a head before leaving the Wormwood, you should bluntly remind them of the consequences of murder. If the keelhauling of Jakes Magpie on the first night aboard the ship doesn’t do the trick, you can have an NPC whom the PCs are growing close to kill someone early on in the adventure, and be keelhauled as punishment.</p>\n<p>Mister Dabrak’s burning ambition leads him to make a return later in the Adventure Path should she somehow survive this adventure. At the table, adventures often take a step away from the predicted plot, and “The Wormwood Mutiny” is no exception. The PCs’ mutiny aboard the Man’s Promise may transpire earlier than is written, or circumstances might dictate that Dabrak and some of her cronies somehow escape. Dabrak is certain to brood upon her lost influence, while avoiding her former captain at all costs. Harrigan is certain to be unforgiving if she finds that Dabrak has lost the Man’s Promise and yet still lives. Dabrak limps away and broods on her failure, slowly whispering words to the powerful and great as she plots her revenge. she can appear again as an accomplice of one of the more powerful pirate lords or as a Free Captain in her own right, with a handpicked crew of cutthroats and a dozen disciplinary officers aboard her new ship, the Severe.</p>\n</div>","img":"modules/monks-enhanced-journal/assets/person.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_d2s7uhtlcf","path":"Pirates of Cyre#/CF_SEP/The Wormwood#/CF_SEP/1.1.

{"name":"Sandara Quinn","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<p>Life is never easy, and Sandara Quinn’s life has been typical of that truism. The daughter of a poor fisherman and a seamstress, Sandara was raised in Hell Harbor. Her overworked parents had little time to spend with their daughter, and Sandara grew up on the port’s hard streets, where she quickly learned to look after herself. She worked on the docks when she could, carrying out what jobs she could get, and soon developed a keen eye for trouble and a reputation for standing up for herself. She began frequenting the bars and taverns of Hell Harbor by the age of 9 and was learning the ropes of sailing by the age of 12.</p>\n<p>Sandara’s calling came one night when a fleet of fishermen, which included her father, was lost in a powerful storm. Sandara prayed to Besmara the Pirate Queen, the goddess of piracy, strife, and sea monsters, and when her father returned the following day, weatherbeaten and half-drowned but still alive, Sandara knew the goddess had answered her prayers. Soon after, Sandara began devoting her time to the worship of Besmara, eventually setting up a small chapel on the Hell Harbor docks dedicated to her.</p>\n<p>Just 3 weeks ago, Sandara’s beloved father died, and she took to the sea, determined to live her life to the hilt, not rot away in some forgotten port. She only made it as far as Port Peril, however, before she fell afoul of Captain Harrigan’s press gang and ended up aboard the Wormwood. There are worse places to be than a pirate ship, however, and Sandara has taken to her new surroundings like a fish returned to the sea from which it was born. She still bears the raw scars of grief from burying her father, but knows enough to mask that grief on a vessel such as the Wormwood. Sandara plans to make the most of her present situation, intending to spread the word of her goddess while expanding her horizons at the same time.</p>\n<p>The night before the adventure starts, Master Scourge made a pass at Sandara, and she responded by slapping the boatswain and making it clear that she finds him repulsive. This event has set up a mutual enmity between the two, while also making her a natural ally of the PCs, should they accept her friendship.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Crowned with a mane of fiery red locks, Sandara looks like someone not to be crossed. Yet the smile lines at the corners of her eyes and the easy way she holds herself hint at a lighter side. She dresses to accentuate her figure, and her whole appearance speaks of the sea, from the seagull feather in her tricorne hat to the sailor tattoos on her arms and the clay pipe thrust into the corner of her mouth.</p>\n<h2>Campaign Role</h2>\n<p>Sandara is designed to give the characters an automatic friend among the Wormwood’s crew—in all likelihood, the only one to begin with. How the PCs first meet Sandara is up to you, but two suggestions might work well. The PCs might already know Sandara before the adventure starts, and she is press-ganged at the same time. Alternatively, Sandara can immediately try to befriend the PCs during their first day on the Wormwood, regarding them as kindred free spirits who have been brought aboard against their will. Having already had a falling out with Master Scourge, Sandara is concerned about her own skin and believes the PCs might make for helpful allies.</p>\n<p>Sandara hasn’t been aboard the ship long, but she already has a good idea of its layout and has heard the other pirates talking, and can share much of this information with the PCs. Use Sandara as a voice of reason between the PCs and the crew, counseling them to avoid attempting anything too dangerous or attracting the ire of Mr. Plugg or Captain Harrigan. She can use her magic to heal injured PCs, and assist them during workdays by adding a +2 bonus on any single check made by a struggling PC, as appropriate.</p>\n<p>As the adventure progresses, Sandara has greater roles to play—first as a prisoner of the grindylows on Bonewrack Isle for the PCs to rescue, and later as an invaluable ally of the PCs when they finally mutiny against Mr. Plugg and Master Scourge at the end of the adventure. She can even become a romantic interest for a PC, if you wish.</p>\n<h3>Too Good To Be True?</h3>\n<p>If met by chance, a character like Sandara might naturally arouse players’ suspicions. Not only is she immediately helpful, but the fact that she returns the PCs’ equipment and happily casts healing spells upon her newfound friends may seem too good to believe. Sandara is free of any sinister motives, however, and is just as she seems.</p>\n<p>Suspicion can be a powerful tool for roleplaying, but be careful not to overdo it and accidentally push the PCs into becoming enemies with Sandara. She is a font of useful knowledge and information, but try not to make her too clever or wise. Sandara likes a drink and a gamble, and these qualities can be used to make her seem vulnerable as well as smart. She can play a significant role throughout the entire Adventure Path as a trusted friend of the PCs, and by starting off well you can quickly make her an important NPC ally.</p>\n<p>It’s extremely unlikely that the PCs make an enemy of Sandara, but if they do, she can become a recurring rival or foe of the PCs. The PCs might very well not be heroes, and their actions may horrify the cleric into joining up with their enemies to oppose them, or might teach her the lesson that no one can ever be trusted, in which case she moves on without them.</p>\n</div>","img":"modules/monks-enhanced-journal/assets/person.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_d2s7uhtlcf","path":"Pirates of Cyre#/CF_SEP/The Wormwood#/CF_SEP/1.1.

{"name":"Ship Punishments","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Ship Punishments</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>To maintain the obedience and effectiveness of their crews, most captains enforce strict schedules and shipboard laws upon their vessels, all maintained by the swift dispensation of brutal punishments. The following presents (in order of severity) the game effects of a variety of typical nautical punishments, which the PCs have the potential to face or inflict during their piratical careers. Most of these sentences are meted out just before the evening meal, at an event typically referred to as the bloody hour. Victims are tied to the whipping post on the main deck and their backs stripped for punishment—with penalties doubled for those who resist. </p>\n<h3>Rope Bash</h3>\n<p>Little more than an admonishment—and occasionally used as a sign of endearment—a rope bash is a single attack with the hefty, sealed end of a ship’s rope.</p>\n<h3>The Lash</h3>\n<p>This is an attack using a whip. Lashes during bloody hour is typically just cause one level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}.</p>\n<h3>Cat-o’-Nine-Tails</h3>\n<p>This is an attack using a cat-o’-ninetails, also referred to simply as a cat—lashes with the cat cause one level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}.</p>\n<h3>Confined in the Sweatbox</h3>\n<p>A cramped metal box left on deck and exposed to the sun, a sweatbox is terribly confining and replicates unbearably hot conditions. Each four hours in the sweatbox the victim must make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Vigor} at –1 for each 8 hours they spend in the sweat box, or suffer a level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}. Any creature with fire resistance is immune to the effects of the sweatbox. Victims typically spend 8, 12 or even 24 hours locked up in the sweatbox.</p>\n<h3>Keelhauling</h3>\n<p>The most frightful of pirate punishments is keelhauling, as it generally ends in death—often by decapitation. Being keelhauled involves being tied to a rope looped over a ship’s keel and dragged down one side of a ship, underwater across the barnacle encrusted hull, and up the other side. Keelhauling can be done either fast or slow. If done fast, the barnacles cut deep and flense the victim, dealing 2d6 points of damage per round. If done slow, shallower cuts are incurred, dealing 1d6 damage per round, but the risk of drowning increases. How long keelhauling takes typically depends on the vessel, with a keelhauling on a ship like the Wormwood taking 6 rounds if done fast and 12 rounds if done slow.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_bv6xzgak7v8","path":"Pirates of Cyre#/CF_SEP/The Wormwood","color":"#000000"},"monks-enhanced-journal":{}},"_id":"NMLLBP57pPzZaEdX"}
{"name":"Ship Roles","content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Ship Roles</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>All crew members on any ship have specific roles and responsibilities, often with harsh punishments being meted out upon those who shirk their duties. Listed here are some of the standard roles aboard a typical ship. Not all of these roles might be represented on every vessel, but such details can help players understand their characters’ daily duties.</p>\n<h3>Artificer/Mage</h3>\n<p>Many ships that ply the waters around Khorvaire have an artificer or mage on board. They can be responsible for the functioning of any magical locomotion of the ship, repairs, general arcane knowledge or any number of other magical needs the ship might have. They are also expected to contribute firepower to any ship to ship conflicts that happen on the vessel. </p>\n<h3>Boatswain</h3>\n<p>The boatswain, or bosun (pronounced “bosun” either way), is responsible for the upper deck of the vessel and above. This makes the boatswain accountable for all rope, rigging, anchors, and sails. At the start of the day, the boatswain and those under her weigh anchor, raise the sails and report on the general condition of the ship’s deck to the captain. As she oversees many of the ship’s basic daily labors, the boatswain is often responsible for keeping discipline and dispensing punishment.</p>\n<h3>Cabin Boy/Girl</h3>\n<p>Servant to the captain and other officers, this low-ranking and typically young crew member assists other sailors in their duties and runs various errands across the ship, requiring him or her to gain a measure of understanding of almost all the ship’s roles.</p>\n<h3>Captain</h3>\n<p>The ultimate authority on any ship, his word is law to all on board. The captain chooses where to sail, what are fitting punishments for breeches in discipline,  and who fills the other stations aboard the vessel, among many other command decisions. Leadership can prove perilous, however, as a captain is, above all, meant to secure success for his ship and crew. Failing to do so increases the threat of mutiny.</p>\n<h3>Carpenter</h3>\n<p>No matter what enchantments or alchemical unguents augment a pirate ship, its heart and bones are still wood. This simple fact makes the carpenter one of the most important positions aboard any vessel. Carpenters are chief ly responsible for maintaining the ship below the deck, finding and plugging leaks, repairing damage, and replacing masts and yards.</p>\n<h3>Cook</h3>\n<p>While the quartermaster normally allocates the rations, the cook and his apprentices make and distribute meals to the crew. Although some better-outfitted vessels employ skilled cooks to attend to the captain and the officers, many cooks are drawn from crew members who have suffered crippling injuries, allowing them to still serve even after such trauma.</p>\n<h3>Healer</h3>\n<p>Many ships have a healer on board to tend to any injuries that happen. Whether this is a House Jorasco healer, Jorasco trained, or some herbalist with slight training in healing, depends on the vessel.</p>\n<h3>Master-at-Arms</h3>\n<p>Concerned with the security of the ship, the fitness of the crew, and the dispensing of justice, the master-at-arms typically is one of the most feared and dreaded of a ship’s officers.</p>\n<h3>Master Gunner</h3>\n<p>The master gunner is in charge of all shipboard artillery, ensuring the weapons are kept in good working order and that the crew knows how to use them. She maintains the ballistas, catapults, and so on.</p>\n<h3>Quartermaster</h3>\n<p>The quartermaster oversees the supplies and items stored aboard the ship. She maintains the supplies of food and weaponry, oversees the disbursement of food to the cook, and doles out the rum ration to the crew.</p>\n<h3>Rigger</h3>\n<p>Riggers work the rigging and unfurl the sails. In battle, next to that of a boarding party, the riggers’ job is one of the most dangerous, as they pull enemy vessels near enough to board.</p>\n<h3>Swab</h3>\n<p>Any sailor who mops the decks. Also used as slang for any low-ranking or unskilled crew member.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_bv6xzgak7v8","path":"Pirates of Cyre#/CF_SEP/The Wormwood","color":"#000000"},"monks-enhanced-journal":{}},"_id":"VHnE6GwCJQDMwm02"}

This is intended to be very pulpy and swashbuckling in nature. So this campaign will need characters that are interested in acquiring fame and/or welath through piracy. This will be a sand box campaign style driven by players. The party will determine the kind of pirates you are. Are you ruthless cutthroats? Are you pirates that have a code of honor? Are there only particular targets you go after? Is everything a target? Do you raid villages? If so, whose? Or do you just stick to the high seas? Do you ruthlessly press-gang locals or sailors to fill the ranks of your ship? Or do you only hire those who want to come on board?</p>\n<p>While there is no expectation for the characters to be ruthless pirates, it is still expected that you will be committing acts of piracy against <em><strong>someone</strong></em><em> </em>or <em><strong>some group</strong></em><em>. </em>Characters are not expected to be evil, however this is one campaign that moral lines can be blurred.

This is intended to be very pulpy and swashbuckling in nature. So this campaign will need characters that are interested in acquiring fame and/or welath through piracy. This will be a sand box campaign style driven by players. The party will determine the kind of pirates you are. Are you ruthless cutthroats? Are you pirates that have a code of honor? Are there only particular targets you go after? Is everything a target? Do you raid villages? If so, whose? Or do you just stick to the high seas? Do you ruthlessly press-gang locals or sailors to fill the ranks of your ship? Or do you only hire those who want to come on board?</p>\n<p>While there is no expectation for the characters to be ruthless pirates, it is still expected that you will be committing acts of piracy against <em><strong>someone</strong></em><em> </em>or <em><strong>some group</strong></em><em>. </em>Characters are not expected to be evil, however this is one campaign that moral lines can be blurred. Greed is expected. Ruthlessness, while not necessary, is a quality that will fit in the campaign.
