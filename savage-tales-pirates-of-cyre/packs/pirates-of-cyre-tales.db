A meeting with a contact had been arranged at @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Salty Dog and The Baron]{the Salty Dog and The Baron} in Pier's End. The meeting went well,and a few more drinks in celebration followed.

After a few drinks at the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Salty Dog and The Baron]{the Salty Dog and The Baron}, you went down to the docks to take in the view of the sea and the ships at port. The last thing you remember is a blow to the back of your head and the waves ruching up to meet you.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">A hero in cramped quarters:</span>  You were between ships in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport}, and after stopping for a drink at a tavern called @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Salty Dog and The Baron]{the Salty Dog and The Baron}, you happened upon a damsel in distress in the alleyway outside. Thinking you could help, you didn’t notice the thugs hiding nearby, and they caught you unawares. You’ve been on enough ships to know a press gang by the blow of the sap on the back of your neck. You just hope whatever ship you end up on has a respectable captain.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Wasted plunder:</span>  You found yourself relatively well off when you got your share of your last voyage’s plunder, and decided to spend a few of your hard-won coins at @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Salty Dog and The Baron]{the Salty Dog and The Baron}, a popular sailor tavern in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport}.

After a few drinks last night, you found yourself uncharacteristically joining into a brawl that started. Though you handled yourself well and just defending your new life long friend's honor. As you staggered around the corner to relieve yourself, you were set upon by a group of rough-looking thugs. They overwhlemed you and knocked you unconscious.

{"_id":"276jgwCRrWKYcf0I","name":"04 Skeleton Crew","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Skeleton Crew</h1>\n<p>At dawn, a few hours after the celebration finally winds down, the ship’s bell sounds, calling all hands on deck. When the crew is assembled, a long line of captured officers and sailors from the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> is brought on deck and paraded before the crew. Prince Rockface addresses the captives first, offering a place on the <em>Storm Reaver's</em> crew for any who want to throw their lot in with pirates. Several of the Rahadoumi sailors step forward; Master Scourge cuts their bonds, and the sailors take their places among the <em>Storm Reaver's</em> crew. Prince Rockface then turns to address the <em>Storm Reaver's</em> crew.</p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“All right, you scurvy tars! You’ve done a right good job by me—we’ve got a second ship now, and she’s quite a prize from the looks of her. But I still have only one crew. So here’s the plan—the <em>Storm Reaver</em> will sail on to our planned destination with our new shipmates here, while Mister Lagraa will pick a skeleton crew to sail the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> to Port Krez, where she’ll be worth a pretty penny as salvage.</p>\n<p>“As for these fine fellows here”—Prince Rockface gestures at the remainder of the captured ship’s crew—“some of them will no doubt be worth a hefty ransom from their families back in Breland. And for the rest, if the life of a pirate’s not for them, they can spend the rest of their lives at sea!”</p>\n</aside>\n<p>To make her point, Prince Rockface grabs one of the Brelish sailors and throws her overboard to the accompaniment of cheers and laughter from the <em>Storm Reaver's</em> crew. As the unfortunate woman sinks beneath the waves, many of the remaining sailors scramble to swear their loyalty to Prince Rockface. The officers are led belowdecks and the crew begins to disperse to their daily tasks.</p>\n<p>As they do, Mister Lagraa and Master Scourge pick out several of the <em>Storm Reaver's</em> original crew, telling them to be aboard the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> within 10 minutes to set sail for Port Krez. The swabs are chosen to join the skeleton crew as well, and Scourge smiles evilly at them as he picks them. The swabs have little time left on the <em>Storm Reaver</em>, but allow them to gather whatever gear or loot they may have acquired, and give them one last chance to purchase supplies from the quartermaster’s store. If any of the swabs have befriended Cut-Throat Grok, she cries as they leave. If she was made helpful, she gives them a gift worth 100 gp from the stores on parting.</p>\n<p>The skeleton crew of the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mister Lagraa (now Captain)</li>\n<li>Master Scourage (now First Mate)</li>\n<li>Patch \"Salty\" Kolkrinun</li>\n<li>Krornik \"Fishguts\" Kragshard</li>\n<li>Owlbear Hartshorn</li>\n<li>The rest of the original crew of the <em>Storm Reaver</em>.</li>\n<li>The swabs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this stage, ensure that there at least eight <em>Storm Reaver</em> pirates loyal to Plugg and Scourge (meaning unfriendly or hostile toward the swabs) aboard the <em>Majestic Griffon</em>. If there are not enough loyal pirates, make up the numbers with Brelish sailors who are naturally grateful to Mister Lagraa for sparing them and allowing them to join his crew. Once everyone is aboard with their gear, the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> sets sail.</p>\n<h2>New Ship, Harsher Discipline</h2>\n<p>As the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> sets sail, acting captain Mister Lagraa and her first mate Master Scourge gather the crew together to inform them that although this is a new ship, the rules are the same, though discipline on the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> will be a good deal harsher than on the lackadaisical <em>Storm Reaver</em>— all crimes are now punishable with the cat instead of the whip. All of the crew keep the same jobs they had before on the <em>Storm Reaver</em>, but they will have to work a good deal harder, as the crew is smaller.</p>\n<p><strong>Fatigue: </strong>From now on all checks to avoid @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} on the ship are made at a -2 penalty. Tasks that did not have a Vigor check for @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}, now require a Vigor check.</p>\n<p>Master Scourge ensures that the swabs continue to have the worst jobs of the crew for the remainder of this journey (you should assign the swabs the worst duties or the duties they most hate every day rather than rolling randomly). As night falls, the sails of the <em>Storm Reaver</em> disappear over the horizon. Mister Lagraa does not believe in crew entertainment or rum rations, and anyone caught above decks after dusk without leave gets six lashes with the cat. At your discretion, gambling might still go on belowdecks, but it is quite likely that Mister Lagraa and Scourge will hear about it and act accordingly.</p>\n<h3>New Destination</h3>\n<p>That night, Mister Lagraa, Scourge, and those pirates loyal to them hold a secret meeting in the captain’s cabin, where they plot to sail the ship not to @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Port Krez]{Port Krez}, but to a dry dock in Cliff's End called @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Rickety's Squibs]{Rickety's Squibs}, where they can make the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> their own and engage in piracy for themselves. Mister Lagraa and Scourge want only the most loyal crew with them, however, and plan to do away with the swabs and their friends as soon as Rickety’s Squibs is in sight. </p>\n<p>Friendly crew members begin whispering their concerns to the swabs by the second day of the voyage. If the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> is sailing back to Port Krez, what is to become of the group of press-ganged crew? Rumors begin to spread among the friendly crew members that Mister Lagraa might decide to claim the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> for himself and establish himself as a pirate captain in his own right. These rumors become more certain when a friendly cremember deduces (if the swabs haven’t already) that the ship has changed course and is heading west past @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Tidewater Rock]{Tidewater Rock} and into Cliff's End. If the swabs have not considered staging a mutiny themselves, friendly crewmembers begin making that suggestion for them, but only when the time is right. </p>\n<p>During the evening, Kragshard suggests to the swabs that he knows where the <em>Majestic Griffon</em> might be heading—to a seedy, isolated dry dock in Cliff's End called @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Rickety's Squibs]{Rickety's Squibs}. For a price, old Rickety Hake completely refits ships into “squibs,” providing new identities by changing ships’ lines, silhouettes, and general appearance to be unrecognizable to their former owners or anyone else familiar with them.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"quick-encounters":{"quickEncounter":"{\"journalEntryId\":\"MMMTZcygBDdHuIMw\",\"extractedActors\":[{\"numActors\":1,\"dataPackName\":\"savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-bestiary\",\"actorID\":\"KEeR7YOKnWikm2I1\",\"name\":\" Krornik Kragshard\",\"savedTokensData\":[],\"generatedTokensData\":[{\"actorId\":\"KEeR7YOKnWikm2I1\",\"isSavedToken\":false}],\"combinedTokensData\":[{\"actorId\":\"KEeR7YOKnWikm2I1\",\"isSavedToken\":false}]}],\"hideQE\":true,\"qeVersion\":\"0.8.4\"}"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0gxlbqom8dl","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/1.

{"_id":"BIeSA05DkU7BT5N1","name":"Sandara Quinn","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<p>Life is never easy, and Sandara Quinn’s life has been typical of that truism. The daughter of a poor fisherman and a seamstress, Sandara was raised in Hell Harbor. Her overworked parents had little time to spend with their daughter, and Sandara grew up on the port’s hard streets, where she quickly learned to look after herself. She worked on the docks when she could, carrying out what jobs she could get, and soon developed a keen eye for trouble and a reputation for standing up for herself. She began frequenting the bars and taverns of Hell Harbor by the age of 9 and was learning the ropes of sailing by the age of 12.</p>\n<p>Sandara’s calling came one night when a fleet of fishermen, which included her father, was lost in a powerful storm. Sandara prayed to Besmara the Pirate Queen, the goddess of piracy, strife, and sea monsters, and when her father returned the following day, weatherbeaten and half-drowned but still alive, Sandara knew the goddess had answered her prayers. Soon after, Sandara began devoting her time to the worship of Besmara, eventually setting up a small chapel on the Hell Harbor docks dedicated to her.</p>\n<p>Just 3 weeks ago, Sandara’s beloved father died, and she took to the sea, determined to live her life to the hilt, not rot away in some forgotten port. She only made it as far as @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport}, however, before she fell afoul of Prince Rockface’s press gang and ended up aboard the <em>Storm Reaver</em>. There are worse places to be than a pirate ship, however, and Sandara has taken to her new surroundings like a fish returned to the sea from which it was born. She still bears the raw scars of grief from burying her father, but knows enough to mask that grief on a vessel such as the <em>Storm Reaver</em>. Sandara plans to make the most of her present situation, intending to spread the word of her goddess while expanding her horizons at the same time.</p>\n<p>The night before the adventure starts, Master Scourge made a pass at Sandara, and she responded by slapping the boatswain and making it clear that she finds him repulsive. This event has set up a mutual enmity between the two, while also making her a natural ally of the PCs, should they accept her friendship.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Crowned with a mane of fiery red locks, Sandara looks like someone not to be crossed. Yet the smile lines at the corners of her eyes and the easy way she holds herself hint at a lighter side. She dresses to accentuate her figure, and her whole appearance speaks of the sea, from the seagull feather in her tricorne hat to the sailor tattoos on her arms and the clay pipe thrust into the corner of her mouth.</p>\n<h2>Campaign Role</h2>\n<p>Sandara is designed to give the characters an automatic friend among the <em>Storm Reaver's</em> crew—in all likelihood, the only one to begin with. How the PCs first meet Sandara is up to you, but two suggestions might work well. The PCs might already know Sandara before the adventure starts, and she is press-ganged at the same time. Alternatively, Sandara can immediately try to befriend the PCs during their first day on the <em>Storm Reaver</em>, regarding them as kindred free spirits who have been brought aboard against their will. Having already had a falling out with Master Scourge, Sandara is concerned about her own skin and believes the PCs might make for helpful allies.</p>\n<p>Sandara hasn’t been aboard the ship long, but she already has a good idea of its layout and has heard the other pirates talking, and can share much of this information with the PCs. Use Sandara as a voice of reason between the PCs and the crew, counseling them to avoid attempting anything too dangerous or attracting the ire of Mr. Plugg or Prince Rockface. She can use her magic to heal injured PCs, and assist them during workdays by adding a +2 bonus on any single check made by a struggling PC, as appropriate.</p>\n<p>As the adventure progresses, Sandara has greater roles to play—first as a prisoner of the grindylows on Bonewrack Isle for the PCs to rescue, and later as an invaluable ally of the PCs when they finally mutiny against Mr. Plugg and Master Scourge at the end of the adventure. She can even become a romantic interest for a PC, if you wish.</p>\n<h3>Too Good To Be True?</h3>\n<p>If met by chance, a character like Sandara might naturally arouse players’ suspicions. Not only is she immediately helpful, but the fact that she returns the PCs’ equipment and happily casts healing spells upon her newfound friends may seem too good to believe. Sandara is free of any sinister motives, however, and is just as she seems.</p>\n<p>Suspicion can be a powerful tool for roleplaying, but be careful not to overdo it and accidentally push the PCs into becoming enemies with Sandara. She is a font of useful knowledge and information, but try not to make her too clever or wise. Sandara likes a drink and a gamble, and these qualities can be used to make her seem vulnerable as well as smart. She can play a significant role throughout the entire Adventure Path as a trusted friend of the PCs, and by starting off well you can quickly make her an important NPC ally.</p>\n<p>It’s extremely unlikely that the PCs make an enemy of Sandara, but if they do, she can become a recurring rival or foe of the PCs. The PCs might very well not be heroes, and their actions may horrify the cleric into joining up with their enemies to oppose them, or might teach her the lesson that no one can ever be trusted, in which case she moves on without them.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"base","_viewcount":4,"role":"Friend of the Players/Swab","location":"The Wormwood","race":"Human","gender":"","age":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":"","profession":"","voice":"","faction":"","height":"","weight":"","traits":"","ideals":"","bonds":"","flaws":"","longterm":"","shortterm":"","beliefs":"","secret":"","DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":{"notes":""},"scrollPos":"{\".description\":50}"},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_wu5utkhw5ta","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/The Storm Reaver#/CF_SEP/Crew of the Storm Reaver","color":"#000000"}}}

As boatswain, he is in charge of all activities and sailors on deck, and as master-at-arms, he is responsible for discipline. Master Scourge is a sneering man with a braided beard and a mouth full of gold teeth. His body is tall and thin, and even his long coat and heavy boots fail to give any impression of strength or bulk. A sadistic coward, Scourge uses his association with Lagraa as protection and in return has no morals when it comes to the tasks his master sets. He is bold and violent when the odds are stacked in his favor, happily kicking a dying dog in the street if asked to do so. But should that dog get up and bite, he quickly f lees.</p>\n<p>Master Scourge is a key villain in the early part of the adventure, and his whispered words further poison Mr. Lagraa against the PCs. Scourge’s relationship with the PCs is a crucial one. He immediately senses something out of the ordinary about them, and his dreams of rank and fortune soon begin to unravel.

{"_id":"MfxQEJpAFYnCf2JW","name":"Krornik \"Fishguts\" Kragshard","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<p>Most people think Krornik “Fishguts” Kragshard gets his nickname from the stains on his apron or the contents of his infamous stew, but few know he earned the sobriquet as a competitive eater in the low bars of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport}. As a young man, it was said that Kragshard could eat more of anything, and faster, than anyone. Folks still talk about the night that Kragshard devoured an entire bucket of boiled eggs in the Salty Swab by the docks.</p>\n<p>Kragshard was trained as a professional chef at the Lobster’s Armor, one of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport}’s most popular (and expensive) restaurants, but when he was thrown out for inappropriate behavior with his assistant, he ended up plying his trade with several sailing vessels in the Lhazaar before embarking on Captain Rockface’s <em>Storm Reaver</em>, where he has served as ship’s cook for the past 3 years.</p>\n<p>An affable fellow, Kragshard loves his food, and has more recently developed a taste for rum, a habit that’s only encouraged by Cut-Throat Grok, the <em>Storm Reaver's</em> quartermaster and Kragshard’s best friend aboard the ship.</p>\n<p>Sadly for Kragshard, his drinking led him to bet his own life against Prince Rockface in a card game one drunken night 2 years ago. Kragshard lost, and his life became Rockface’s to do with what he would. Rockface now thinks as little of Kragshard as he does a bilge rat, but he’s not yet killed the cook because drunk as he is, Kragshard is still a better cook than anyone else on the <em>Storm Reaver</em>, and the captain is partial to his cooking.</p>\n<p>Kragshard’s days begin with blearily handing out ship’s biscuits to the crew on deck before retiring to the galley to prepare the evening meal (almost always fish stew) in a big pot. Then he cozies up with a bottle of rum (sometimes mixed with raw eggs) and waits for the rest of the day to pass. Nevertheless, Kragshard is a skilled chef, though few of the crew beyond the captain and his officers ever get the chance to sample Kragshard’s more palatable fare.</p>\n<p>His only joy, aside from drinking and swapping yarns with Grok, are his chickens. Kragshard loves his poultry and collects any rare breeds he comes across. Anyone with a background in farming finds Kragshard friendly, while those who truly know their birds quickly discover a helpful friend. Kragshard’s favorite bird, a large black cockerel named Black-Hearted Bezebel, often perches on the cook’s shoulder and even talks to him, or so Kragshard occasionally drunkenly claims.</p>\n<h3>Appearance</h3>\n<p>Kragshard is a large, some would say fat, man, weighing well over 200 pounds and standing only 5 feet tall. He exudes an air of neglect, perhaps even despair, from the bushy tufts of black hair behind his ears, to his rotting teeth, to the stains on his filthy apron. He walks with a wallowing waddle, particularly when drunk, but is capable of surprising acts of strength. Kragshard talks with a thick Shackles accent, which some people find hard to follow. He’s had so many lashes that his back is like tanned leather, and he claims to not even feel the bite of the lash anymore. After 44 years in the school of hard knocks, Kragshard is a man who clearly cares little for himself or what people think of him. Nevertheless, he is at heart a kind man, and does his best to protect his cook’s mate from punishments brought on by mistakes made by either of them.</p>\n<h3>Gossip</h3>\n<p>The PCs can learn the following about Kragshard with successful Diplomacy checks to gather information.</p>\n<p>DC 5: “Fishguts” might once have been a famous chef at that fancy place in @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport}, but now all he cooks is fishgut stew. He’s so pickled in rum now, bilgewater is all he can make.</p>\n<p>DC 10: Remember the last cook’s mate? Nobody does—only when he disappeared. Just up and vanished, that one, like he was spirited away, or maybe dropped in a pot...</p>\n<p>DC 15: Kragshard was so drunk once that he bet his life in a game with the captain, and now he’s little more than Rockface’s slave.</p>\n<h3>CampaiGn Role</h3>\n<p>Krornik Kragshard begins the adventure as a cynical, washed up drunk who is insensibly intoxicated half of the time, dreaming of a better life. However, he is also an obvious potential friend and ally of the PCs, as he loathes the captain and crew of the <em>Storm Reaver</em> and longs for a chance to escape. Kragshard makes an excellent NPC to plant the idea of mutiny in the PCs’ minds. He is not a risktaker, however, and can, like Sandara Quinn (see page 56), act as a voice of reason as the PCs plan their actions. If the PCs manage to befriend Kragshard, he can become a useful ally for the PCs in the future. Besides being a fine cook, he has handy communication skills and can also help out in a fight if needed. Kragshard has also plied his trade in the Shackles throughout his life and has an excellent knowledge of the region and its perils, personalities, and possibilities.</p>\n<p>As the adventure progresses, Kragshard’s interactions with the PCs begin to give his life purpose, to the extent that by the time the PCs move to the Man’s Promise in Part Two, he begins drinking much less. Away from the sour atmosphere of the <em>Storm Reaver</em>, Kragshard’s spirits lighten, and he is only drunk 1 day in every four. When the PCs finally mutiny, Kragshard is sober for the event, and aids the PCs as best he can. If the mutiny is successful, Kragshard announces that his new friends have inspired him to turn over a new leaf. If the PCs are cutthroats, Kragshard throws his lot in with them to begin a new life. If they are kindhearted dandies, Kragshard sees in them a more honorable way of life. Regardless, he offers his services as ship’s cook to the PCs. His lapses into drinking become less frequent—he is now drunk only 1 day in every week—and continue to be so throughout the rest of the Adventure Path.</p>\n<p>It is unlikely that the PCs will make an enemy of Kragshard, but should they do so, he gladly assists anyone who wants to kill the PCs. Having had a taste of possible freedom, he wants to punish those who let him taste it before he crawls back into the bottom of a rum bottle to die.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"base","_viewcount":3,"role":"Ship's Cook","location":"The Wormwood","race":"Male Dwarf","gender":"","age":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":"","profession":"","voice":"","faction":"","height":"","weight":"","traits":"","ideals":"","bonds":"","flaws":"","longterm":"","shortterm":"","beliefs":"","secret":"","DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":{"notes":""},"scrollPos":"{\".description\":50}"},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_wu5utkhw5ta","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/The Storm Reaver#/CF_SEP/Crew of the Storm Reaver","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"OFdQGATN7TtJNvRX","name":"01 Welcome to the Storm Reaver","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Welcome to the Storm Reaver</h1>\n<p>The pirates wake up the in the hold of Prince Rockface's the <em>Storm Reaver</em> of the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cloudreaver Principality]{Cloudreaver Principality}. They all remember the night before, but they all blacked out at some point. The pirates awake feeling groggy like they are still hung over. Before the pirates can do much more than sit up, Master Scourge enters the hold to wake them and get them up to the main deck. Six rough-looking <em>Storm Reaver</em> pirates, armed with saps, accompany him. An expression that might be mistaken for pain but which is clearly an attempt at a smile bruises Scourge's face as he cracks the whip in his hand and screams at newcomers.</p>\n<aside class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“Still abed with the sun over the yardarm? On your feet, ye filthy swabs! Get up on deck and report for duty afore Prince Rockface flays your flesh into sausage skins and has Fishguts fry ye up for breakfast!”</p>\n</aside>\n<p>The pirates quickly discover that most, if not all, of their weapons and equipment are gone. If the any refuse, even momentarily, to accompany Scourge, he lashes out at any offender with his whip. If necessary, he calls for aid from his crew, who attack uncooperative characters with their saps. It should be immediately clear that if they don't cooperate, they will quickly be overpowered. </p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> If the pirates decide to fight, Master Scourge and his pirates attack subduing them. The <em>Storm Reaver</em> pirates will not the kill the new comers, however. Once they have the upper hand, they will take the offender—conscious or unconscious—to the main deck, where they get an immediate taste of @Compendium[savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-tales.Ship Punishments]{punishment} on the <em>Storm Reaver</em>. The offenders are tied to the mainmast, and Master Scourge gives each of them three lashes before the captain's address.</p>\n<p class=\"example\"><strong>Skill Check:</strong> On the way to the upper deck, have the pirates make notice checks. On a <strong>success </strong>they hear someone making oinking sounds and talking soothingly to was sounds like a pig. On a raise someon hears the rattle of a chain, and a slight whimper.</p>\n<h2>Meeting the Captain</h2>\n<p>Once on the main deck it's quickly apparent that they are on a sizable ship in the middle of the ocean, far from any land. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Regalport]{Regalport} and @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Greentarn]{Greentarn} are just an ochre haze many miles astern. Figures cluster around the ship's mainmast, looking up at the higher deck on the stern, where two figures stand, Prince Rockface and First Mate Mister Lagraa.</p>\n<p>There are three other recruits are standing with them on the deck, set apart by their relative cleanliness and their apparent unease with their newfound situation. The other three were picked up in Elysium, Sandara Quinn, Rosie Cusswell, and Conchobhar Turlach Dalian. A dozen or so other pirates stand about on the deck or in the ship's rigging. Once everyone is on the main deck, the captain speaks.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar read-aloud\">\n<p>“Glad you could join us at last! Welcome to the <em>Storm Reaver</em>! My thanks for ‘volunteering' to join my crew. I'm Mika Rockface. That's Prince Rockface to you filthy lot, not that you'll ever need to address me. I have only one rule—don't speak to me. I like talk, but I don't like your talk. Follow that rule and we'll all get along fine.</p>\n<p>“Oh, and one more thing. Even with you new recruits, we're still short-handed, and I aim to keep what crew I have. There'll be a keelhaulin' for anyone caught killin' anyone. Mr. Lagraa! If you'd be so kind as to make pirates out of these landlubbers, it'll save me having to put them in the sweatbox for a year and a day before I make pies out of 'em.”</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Job Assignments</h2>\n<p>After some recent difficulties, the <em>Storm Reaver </em>is undermanned and there are some roles that need to be filled. Mister Lagraa first is looking for a new rigger. The scoundrals are all required to climb to the crows nest.</p>\n<p class=\"example\"><strong>Dramatic Task</strong> This will require 3 round Dramtic Task. @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} checks are the only skilled allowed. The pirate with the most success tokens is the winner is that they are now a rigger and work directly for Mister Lagraa. Anyone caught deliberately trying to fail the test will be immediately given three lashes as @Compendium[savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-tales.Ship Punishments]{punishment}.</p>\n<p>Lagraa's second test is one of necessity—he knows the ship's cook, Krornik “Fishguts” Kragshard, has a drinking problem, and he's fed up with eating rubbish. This test is simple: Lagraa asks each pirate in turn whether they can cook, and if one of them says yes, theybecoe the new cook's mate. If Lagraa gets to the end of the line without an affirmative answer, he simply picks the fattest pirate (Lagraa assumes that character likes food the most) and says, “You're a cook's mate now,” and tells that PC to report to Krornik Kragshard in the galley. If more than one person claims to be a good cook, Lagraa picks the fattest.</p>\n<p>The remaining pirates are all assigned to be swabs, under the command of Master Scourge, who immediately gets them working. </p>\n<p>Review @Compendium[savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-tales.A Pirate's Day]{A Pirate's Day} and @Compendium[savage-tales-pirates-of-cyre.pirates-of-cyre-tales.Ship Board Actions]{Ship Board Actions} to find out more what the pirates do during the day.

This morning she managed to acquire two items of the new crew members, items that they would struggle without the use of. At some point on this first day she will approach the new comers as soon as she can to return equipment and offer her friendship. She can explain the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is not what you know but who you know on a pirate ship. Friends help each other out, enemies cause trouble.</li>\n<li>She knows Prince Mika is upset as they have not had a very successful outting at sea, and once again she couldn't crack Tidewater Rock.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>A Keelhauling</h2>\n<p><strong>Work:</strong> The pirates spend the day at their assigned jobs.

A successful @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} can see the relish with which Mr. Lagraa, in particular, tugs at the rope as the unfortunate Magpie is dragged under the ship. What appears on the other side has been cut to shreds and is soon thrown overboard to feed the sharks.</p>\n<p>A pirate who examines the body before it is dumped can make a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Healing]{Healing} check to estimate that the unfortunate Jakes took significant damage from the punishment and drowned as well.

{"_id":"QygQfqdlw5zh5IkL","name":"Ship Punishments","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Ship Punishments</h1>\n<p>To maintain the obedience and effectiveness of their crews, most captains enforce strict schedules and shipboard laws upon their vessels, all maintained by the swift dispensation of brutal punishments. The following presents (in order of severity) the game effects of a variety of typical nautical punishments, which the pirates have the potential to face or inflict during their piratical careers. Most of these sentences are meted out just before the evening meal, at an event typically referred to as the bloody hour. Victims are tied to the whipping post on the main deck and their backs stripped for punishment—with penalties doubled for those who resist. </p>\n<h3>Rope Bash</h3>\n<p>Little more than an admonishment—and occasionally used as a sign of endearment—a rope bash is a single attack with the hefty, sealed end of a ship’s rope.</p>\n<h3>The Lash</h3>\n<p>This is an attack using a whip. Lashes during bloody hour require a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Vigor} check (+1) for every three lashes or cause one level of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}.</p>\n<h3>Cat-o’-Nine-Tails</h3>\n<p>This is an attack using a cat-o’-ninetails, also referred to simply as a cat—lashes with the cat require a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Vigor} check (–1) one level of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} for every three strikes.</p>\n<h3>Confined in the Sweatbox</h3>\n<p>A cramped metal box left on deck and exposed to the sun, a sweatbox is terribly confining and replicates unbearably hot conditions. Each four hours in the sweatbox the victim must make a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Vigor} check or suffer a level of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}. There is a –1 to this check for each 8 hours they spend in the sweat box. Any creature with fire resistance is immune to the effects of the sweatbox. Victims typically spend 8, 12 or even 24 hours locked up in the sweatbox.</p>\n<h3>Keelhauling</h3>\n<p>The most frightful of pirate punishments is keelhauling, as it generally ends in death—often by decapitation. Being keelhauled involves being tied to a rope looped over a ship’s keel and dragged down one side of a ship, underwater across the barnacle encrusted hull, and up the other side. Keelhauling can be done either fast or slow. If done fast, the barnacles cut deep and flense the victim, dealing 2d6 points of damage per round. If done slow, shallower cuts are incurred, dealing 1d6 damage per round, but the risk of drowning increases. How long keelhauling takes typically depends on the vessel, with a keelhauling on a ship like the <em>Storm Reaver</em> taking 6 rounds if done fast and 12 rounds if done slow.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_f5h8exvluwf","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Ship lore","color":"#000000"}}}

Drawing near, the group sees signs of a recent and bloody battle—several large holes are clearly visible in her side and corpses litter the splintered, bloodsoaked deck.</p>\n<p>As the heroes watch, a lone figure staggers onto the deck from the rear cabins. Spying them, the figure tries to reach the side of ship, waving frantically as he lurches forward. He barely makes half a dozen steps before he falls lifeless to the planks.</p>\n<p>On boarding, the heroes discover a scene of absolute carnage. A successful Common Knowledge roll reveals most of the injuries were not inflicted in battle. Most of the corpses have been horribly mutilated in some way. Characters failing a Fear check are violently sick and gain a level of Fatigue which is only recovered 30 minutes after leaving the Conquistador.</p>\n<h3>The Survivor</h3>\n<p>The survivor is unconscious and badly bleeding. Both of his hands have been severed at the wrists and his nose has been hacked off. A successful Healing roll staunches the blood flow and returns the man to consciousness. Once awake, he tells his tale.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“My name is Jim Black, ship’s cook. Pirates attacked us barely two hours ago. Having no escort, the captain saw fit to surrender, planning on trading the cargo for our lives. He assembled us on the deck and raised a flag of surrender. The swines raked the deck with grapeshot before boarding.</p>\n<p>“The captain offered his cargo without a struggle but the pirate captain shot him on the spot. They took the cargo but they had no intention of letting us live. The pirate captain had every man butchered—gutted some, amputated limbs off others, and even made some of them eat their own body parts.</p>\n<p>“That devil hacked off my nose and tried to make me eat it. I put on a brave face, hoping he’d show mercy if I didn’t beg, and said it needed pepper. He asked my trade, and when I told him he hacked my hands off and left me here to die. What use am I now with no hands, eh? There’s still cargo below if you want it—I’m not going to put up a fight.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>Jim describes the pirate captain. Any character who took part in  The Low Down (157) and makes a Common Knowledge roll recognizes the man as the mariner they rescued. Jim adds that the pirate ship was a galleon called the Mad Dog and it sailed away east.</p>\n<p>Below deck are two cargo spaces worth of food—Low’s ship lacked room to store the entire cargo.</p>\n<h3>Hunting the Mad Dog</h3>\n<p>If the heroes decline the cargo and set off immediately, the Mad Dog has a three-hour lead. Taking the Conquistador’s cargo increases the lead to six hours. How much head start Low has is irrelevant—but don’t tell the group.</p>\n<p>Believing the Conquistador’s crew to be dead, Low is in no rush to escape. Riding hard with the wind, the heroes spy a sail on the horizon shortly before dusk. Use the standard Chase rules. When the ships draw level, Low recognizes the heroes as his rescuers and shouts across to them.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“Well strike me down! I never thought I’d see you fine chaps again. I have no beef with you lads—you did get me a good turn and that’s a rare thing. I’ll return the favor now—turn sail and run ‘n I’ll let you go in peace. Continue your present course and I’ll watch you eat your own lips as you beg for mercy.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>Low will actually let the heroes sail away in peace if they choose to turn around. Should they cross his path a second time he has no hesitation about killing them—he considers the favor repaid in full. Of course, he’ll also take great delight in boarding their ship and cutting off their lips if they try to slug it out.</p>\n<p>If the group loses the fight and surrenders, Low does indeed cut off their lips, as well as their ears and noses—each character gains the Ugly Hindrance—before letting them go as a warning to others.</p>\n<h3>The Mad Dog (Galleon)</h3>\n<p>Acc/Top Speed: 2/12; Travel Speed: 3; Handling: –3; Toughness: 20(4); Crew: 30+40; Cargo Space: 6; Guns: 20 Notes: Heavy Armor; Low has sacrificed cargo space for additional cannons.</p>\n<p>Pirates (65): 60 Pirates and five Veteran Pirate officers (p. 195).</p>\n<p>Booty: A King’s Ransom aboard the Mad Dog.

Bolstered by gold and good drink, the party lasts for 36 hours, well into the next night. Naturally, no work takes place during the party. During this time, the swabs can take up to 5 ship actions of their choice, or do nothing but drink and revel like most of the pirate crew does.</p>\n<p><strong>Treasure:</strong> Each swab receives 150 gp in coinage as his or her share of the booty, modified by the following factors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the swabs took the aft deck and sterncastle within 6 rounds, they receive two @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Potion of Healing, Major]{Potion of Healing, Major} and a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Potion of Invisibility, Minor]{Potion of Invisibility, Minor}, and each is awarded an additional 100 gp.</li>\n<li>If a swab warned Prince Rockface as he was being attacked in Round 3, the swabs receive an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Amulet of Natural Armor, Minor]{Amulet of Natural Armor, Minor}. If the swabs also killed the attacking sailor, they receive a short sword (accurate) as well.</li>\n<li>If the swabs did not warn the captain when he was being attacked, each swab receives only a half share of plunder (75 gp).</li>\n<li>For each sailor captured by the swabs, the swabs receive +25 gp to divide among themselves.</li>\n<li>If the swabs killed the First Mate in Round 11, they receive an additional 100 gp to divide among themselves. This reward increases to 200 gp if the swabs managed to capture the officer alive.</li>\n<li>For each pirate accidentally killed, deduct 150 gp from the party’s reward.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> If any swabs did not take part in the battle and are discovered, they are accused of cowardice and given a dozen lashes with the cat before the plunder is distributed.

{"_id":"a5dWjtPnSBr1tjnt","name":"Ship Roles","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Ship Roles</h1>\n<p>All crew members on any ship have specific roles and responsibilities, often with harsh punishments being meted out upon those who shirk their duties. Listed here are some of the standard roles aboard a typical ship. Not all of these roles might be represented on every vessel, but such details can help players understand their characters’ daily duties.</p>\n<h2>Officers</h2>\n<h3>Captain</h3>\n<p>The ultimate authority on any ship responsible for the ship and everything aboard her, his word is law to all on board. The captain chooses where to sail, what are fitting punishments for breeches in discipline,  and who fills the other stations aboard the vessel, among many other command decisions. The captain is the voice of the crew to all beyond the ship. In terms of daily duties, the captain keeps a log of the voyage, manages the affairs of the ship through the officers, working with the navigator to plot courses, and generally serves a four to six hour shift at the helm. Leadership can prove perilous, however, as a captain is, above all, meant to secure success for his ship and crew. Failing to do so increases the threat of mutiny.</p>\n<h3>First Mate</h3>\n<p>The first mate is the number two man on the ship. She is responsible for enforcing the ship’s articles and administering punishment when necessary. The first mate is the trustee of the ship and her crew, often being elected by the crew to the position. She directly represents the crew to the captain. It is her responsibility to serve as a counterbalance to the captain in decisions that might be hazardous to the ship or the crew. A wise captain makes no decisions that his first mate doesn't support. The first mate takes responsibility for prize vessels and picks the treasure that the crew will take from a prize. She is also responsible for counting the booty and splitting the shares according to each crewmembers due. Each day will find her working with her subordinate officers the boatswain, the master gunner, and the master at arms to effectively run the ship. The first mate also serves a turn at the helm, generally a four to six hour shift.</p>\n<h3>Navigator</h3>\n<p>The navigator is responsible for plotting the ship’s course and maintaining that course, thus requiring an strong education and excellent all around seamanship. The navigator maintains all of the ship’s charts and maps as well as the tools of navigation. He is charged with keeping a daily log of every event relating to the sailing of the ship. He records the depth, the currents, the wind patterns, the ship’s location, the locations of reefs and sandbars, and the state of the rigging. He reports directly to the captain. The pilot oversaw the work of the sail-master and almost always has at least one assistant (a pilot’s mate) to help him with his duties. The pilot and his mate both serve separate shifts at the helm in addition to taking readings from the moons and stars to plot and maintain the course.</p>\n<h3>Boatswain</h3>\n<p>The boatswain, or bosun (pronounced “bosun” either way), is responsible for maintaining the ship's seaworthy status. This makes the boatswain accountable for all rope, rigging, anchors, and sails. His duties were to make certain that all the work of running the ship is done. This would also include keeping the watches and maintaining discipline among the deck crew. At the start of the day, the boatswain and those under her weigh anchor, raise the sails and report on the general condition of the ship’s deck to the first mate. The boatswain was often the most feared man on the ship because his obligations often made him uncompromising. It was his responsibility to keep everything “ship-shape”. Day and night, the boatswain drives the crew to do whatever work is required. He maintains the watch log and reports any problems to the first mate.</p>\n<h3>Quartermaster</h3>\n<p>The quartermaster oversees all the supplies and items stored aboard the ship. She maintains the supplies of food, water, sails, rope, wood, and tar, oversees the disbursement of food to the cook, and doles out the rum ration to the crew. The quartermaster also directs the loading of cargo into the hold to maintain the proper ballast to ensure level sailing.</p>\n<h3>Artificer/Mage</h3>\n<p>Many ships that ply the waters around Khorvaire have an artificer and/or mage on board. They can be responsible for the functioning of any magical locomotion of the ship, repairs, general arcane knowledge or any number of other magical needs the ship might have. They are also expected to contribute firepower or counter enemy magical firepower in any ship to ship conflicts that happen on the vessel. </p>\n<h3>Master-at-Arms</h3>\n<p>The Master at Arms is often the most skilled warrior on the crew. He is responsible for training the crew in hand to hand combat. He also leads the ship’s boarding parties and hunting parties when they are necessary. The Master at Arms position is not a separate position on every vessel and often these responsibilities fall to the first mate or quartermaster. When the master at arms position is filled on a ship, he takes orders from and reports to the first mate.</p>\n<h3>Master Gunner</h3>\n<p>The master gunner is in charge of all shipboard artillery, ensuring the weapons are kept in good working order, repaired, and that the crew knows how to use them. She maintains the ballistas, catapults, and so on. The master gunner picks, trains and runs the gunnery crew. He reports to the first mate, but was responsible to the entire ship to make sure the artillery hits the target. He day to day duties consists of drilling the gunnery crew and maintaining the weapons.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:1.125em\">Crew</span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:1.125em\">Sail-Master</span></h3>\n<p>The Sail-master is the most experienced crewman in the rigging and usually one of the best sailors on the ship. He is responsible for maintaining the sails and the rigging. The Sail-master knows every knot, line, rope, block and tackle in the rigging as well as how to repair them all. He is also responsible for training and running the sail crew as well as overseeing the making and patching of sails. The Sail-master takes orders from and reports to the navigator.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:1.125em\">Cabin Boy/Girl</span></h3>\n<p>Servant to the captain and other officers, this low-ranking and typically young crew member assists other sailors in their duties and runs various errands across the ship, requiring him or her to gain a measure of understanding of almost all the ship’s roles.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:1.125em\">Carpenter</span></h3>\n<p>No matter what enchantments or alchemical unguents augment a pirate ship, its heart and bones are still wood. This simple fact makes the carpenter one of the most important positions aboard any vessel. Carpenters are chiefly responsible for maintaining the ship below the deck, finding and plugging leaks, repairing damage, and replacing masts and yards. Carpenters are also responsible for the construction of barrels and crates as necessary to store cargo. The carpenter reports to the boatswain.</p>\n<h3>Cook</h3>\n<p>While the quartermaster normally allocates the rations, the cook and his apprentices make and distribute meals to the crew. Although some better-outfitted vessels employ skilled cooks to attend to the captain and the officers, many cooks are drawn from crew members who have suffered crippling injuries, allowing them to still serve even after such trauma.The cook takes orders from either the quartermaster or the boatswain.</p>\n<h3>Healer</h3>\n<p>Many ships have a healer on board to tend to any injuries that happen. Whether this is a House Jorasco healer, Jorasco trained, or some herbalist with slight training in healing, depends on the vessel. The healer takes orders from the first mate.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:1.125em\">Rigger</span></h3>\n<p>Riggers work the rigging and unfurl the sails. In battle, next to that of a boarding party, the riggers’ job is one of the most dangerous, as they pull enemy vessels near enough to board. Riggers report to the sail-master and the boatswain.</p>\n<h3>Swab</h3>\n<p>Any sailor who mops the decks. Also used as slang for any low-ranking or unskilled crew member.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_f5h8exvluwf","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Ship lore","color":"#000000"}}}

The mainmast rises from the center of the deck, extending 60 feet into the air and topped by a crow’s nest. Rigging connects the mainmast to the ship’s other masts and can be crossed with DC 10 Acrobatics or Climb checks. Several strands of thick rope are secured to the foot of the mainmast for use as a whipping post. An Escape Artist check (DC 20 + the binder’s CMB) is required to escape the bonds. The ship’s clock, a macabre brass-and copper object depicting worms writhing through whale corpses, hangs from the mast above the whipping post. Not only does the clock keep time, but its bell strikes at dawn and dusk to signal the beginning and the end of the workday.</p>\n<p>Two 10-foot-square hatches sit in the deck fore and aft of the mainmast.

At the fore of the ship, two doors lead into the officers’ quarters (area A4), while two doors aft lead to the captain’s quarters (area A5). A large wooden box bound in iron sits just beneath the bridge. This sweatbox, used to torment sailors, has just enough room to hold one Medium creature (and can be altered to confine a Small creature). It is locked with a good lock (Disable Device DC 30); Prince Rockface and Mr. Plugg have the keys.</p>\n<p>A small jolly boat (same statistics as a rowboat) sits on the deck next to the port rail.

{"_id":"e8jhDVoMZBZ4P6hq","name":"Treasure for the Taking","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Treasure for the Taking</h1>\n<p>“Stumpy” Pete, a regular at the Shipwreck Surprise, has two wooden legs (hence the name). Since being washed up on the island last year he has worked as Azy’s accountant— he’s not much use as a farmer or sailor. The locals suspect he has a hidden stash of treasure somewhere on the island but countless searches have revealed nothing.</p>\n<p>Stumpy approaches the group while they are drinking in the tavern. He invites them to join him for a drink and to partake in a business venture.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“Name’s Stumpy Pete,” he slurs, obviously the worse for drink. “Afore I came to the cay I was a pirate by trade working under a French corsair by the name of Pierre La Grange. He was small fry compared to some—at least until we found treasure.</p>\n<p>“While exploring an island north of the Whips we discovered a stash of treasure buried in a ruined building. We was only a small crew, just the ten of us, but we struck it rich beyond our wildest dreams. Gold, silver, and jewels in abundance just waiting for us to find it.</p>\n<p>“We took what we could carry and left the rest, planning on returning when we could. The captain said carrying too much would make us an easy target if other pirates found out. We spent most of our loot in Baltimus before heading to Shark Bay to acquire a larger ship. Never made it that far though. The ship sank in a storm somewhere off the coast of this island. I was lucky—I was washed up here. Lost my other leg but at least I’m alive.</p>\n<p>“I can tell you doubt my story and I don’t blame you. If you want some proof the treasure exists then look no further.” With that, he removes his right leg and holds it upside down over the table. A small bag slides out and lands with a soft clunk. Stumpy opens the bag to reveal two dozen small diamonds.</p>\n<p>“This is just a taste of what we found. I can’t trust these pirates to help me, but if you’ll take me to the island I’ll share the booty with you— fifty-fifty.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>No one on the island knows Stumpy has the gems—he exchanges them for coin with visiting crews. The treasure is real and the offer genuine. Hard bargaining and a raise on a Persuasion roll can increase the group’s share to 75% of the haul. The only thing “Stumpy” failed to mention was the horrible creature guarding the treasure—another reason he has never returned to the island.</p>\n<p>Stumpy Pete Pete lost his first leg to grapeshot and the second when he was shipwrecked off Azy Cay. He is content with his life on the Cay—he has a steady job, his own shack, and his booty goes further than it would in a big city. All he wants now is the rest of the treasure to see him through in comfort to his dying days. Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d8, Spirit d8, Strength d6, Vigor d8 Skills: Boating d6, Climbing d8, Fighting d8, Intimidation d6, Notice d6, Swimming d6 Charisma: 0; Pace: 2; Parry: 6; Toughness: 6 Hindrances: Bad Luck, One Leg (twice—suffers –4 penalty to traits requiring mobility and cannot run), Stubborn Edges: Dirty Fighting, Fast Healer, Frugal, Harder to Kill, Rich Gear: Two pistols, crutches, cutlass (Str+d6).</p>\n<h2>Treasure Island</h2>\n<p>The island lies 70 miles due north of Kuwayway and does not appear on any charts—it’s simply too small. Rising steeply from the sea, the cliffs tower 100 feet above the surrounding water. Atop is a rugged plateau covered in dense forest. Aside from a small colony of monkapes and some razor wings the island is uninhabited. Actually that isn’t true—the Sea Hags know about the treasure and sent a guardian to watch over it. (See below for details.)</p>\n<p>Scaling the cliffs requires three Climbing rolls. Failure results in a drop of 1d6 x 5 yards. Stumpy can’t climb and must be winched to the top.</p>\n<p>After getting his bearings, Stumpy leads the group north through the forest. The short walk to the ruin involves crossing rugged ground and hacking through the forest—not to mention having to walk at Stumpy’s slow pace. Have everyone make Vigor rolls. A failure results in a level of Fatigue, recovered after 15 minutes rest.</p>\n<p>The ruin once served as a Kieran noble’s hunting retreat but fell into disuse after the Flood. The owner and servants are all dead— drowned in an attempt to cross the Flotsam Sea and reach the “safety” of Kiera. Thick vines cling to the walls and only the main entrance shows any sign of disturbance—this is where “Stumpy” and his crew entered last year.</p>\n<p>The treasure belonged to a pirate (now resting at the bottom of sea) who found the island several years ago and thought it a safe place to conceal his loot.</p>\n<p>Have the characters make Notice rolls. On a success, they realize Stumpy has grown very nervous, wringing his hands and glancing quickly from side to side. If questioned he says, “Strange being back that’s all. Reminds me of my dead shipmates. Come on, the loot’s in the ballroom. Let’s get it and go.”</p>\n<p>Stumpy leads the group to the ballroom and points to some flagstones in the far corner. The stones lift easily to reveal six chests, each full to bursting with treasure. Disturbing the chests alerts the Sea Hags’ guardian lurking in the forest nearby. It attacks as the group leaves the ruin.</p>\n<p> Guardian Beast: The guardian beast is actually a giant zombie monkape, placed here by the Sea Hags to guard the treasure. Use the statistics for a regular giant monkape (p. 192) but add the Fear, Fearless, and Undead Special Ability (as per a zombie). The beast concentrates its attacks on the character carrying the mummified head.</p>\n<p> Booty: Two King’s Ransoms. In addition there is a golden triangle engraved with strange writing and a wooden box containing a mummified head.</p>\n<h2>Mummified Head</h2>\n<p>The head is the true reason the Sea Hags sent a guardian to the island. It belonged to a powerful archmage who sacrificed his life to give the inhabitants of Caribdus a chance to defeat the three sisters. The head is alive—sort of—and can still use its magic. When the lid is lifted the eyes open and a disembodied voices speaks to the heroes, “My magic is yours to command but only against the three sisters.”</p>\n<p>It has 50 Power Points, a d12+2 Spellcasting, and knows every spell, but can only cast them in the final battles against the Sea Hags. Power Points are not recharged—once the last one is spent the head crumbles to dust.</p>\n<p>Neither the Hags nor their minions can touch the head or affect it with magic—hence the zombie monkape guardian.</p>\n<p>If the group has already defeated the Sea Hags the head is less powerful—it can teach a mage a single spell, ignoring the usual rank requirement. This takes 2d6 hours of instruction, after which the mage may add to spell to his repertoire. The head then crumbles to dust.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_53dtyb3i8lp","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/2.

Gone! No one would help us after the Mournland rolled through. We were even forgotten from the negotiating table at the laughable Treaty of Thronehold. As well intended as Prince Oargev might be, New Cyre is on Brelish land. There no telling when the \"generosity\" of that throne (or the Parliment) will want their land back. There is little hope that the Mournland can be reversed. Even if it could, there is not enough Cyrans left to stop the rush of Karrns, Thranes, and Brelanders that would come in to take the land. </p>\n<p>If Cyre is to survive, you need to take matters into your own hands. You have lived your life on the sea for Cyre, so it's time to take what you know and see how you can support Cyre. Since nobody seems to care about Cyrans, maybe it is time to take what we can to give to those Cyrans who now have nothing. So now it is time to turn to piracy to help out the Cryans that survive. The @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Lhazaar Principalities]{Lhazaar Principalities} are too chaotic and disjointed now with the largest shipping lanes in Khorvaire after the loss of the Great Canal. It is time to take some of the wealth from those that have so much to help those that have lost so much. Who knows, with a kind eye from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Arawai]{Arawai}, and a blessing from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.The Devourer]{the Devourer}, maybe you might acquire enough plunder and noteriety (or Infamy) to be able to claim some land or even a prinipality for the survivors of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Cyre]{Cyre}. </p>\n<h2>Campaign Intention</h2>\n<p>In the Pirates of Cyre campaign, you are going to take on the role of Cyrans who survived the Day of Mourning or those friendly and sympathetic to the Cyran plight. Fed up with how Cyrans are being treated by the other nations, you are choosing to use your life long knowledge of the sea, to turn to piracy.</p>\n<p>This campaign is intended to be a very pulpy and swashbuckling in nature. It will start off on some rails, but will open up into a large sand box that will be very much driven by you.</p>\n<p>Your reasons for turning to piracy could include any number of reasons. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prince Oargev, or someone who has his ear, has asked or planted a seed in you to use your skills in this manner to find a new home for Cyrans or at least send money to support New Cyre.</li>\n<li>Perhaps you fear that Breland will eventually kick Cyrans out of New Cyre and leave everyone you know and love left, once again homeless. You can change that.</li>\n<li>You are just plain bitter at any number of the other nations for what they did to Cyre. Either for unjustly starting the new war, what you see as war crimes during the war, shutting their doors to your people in thier time of greatest need, or something else. Regardless, you are only giving them what they deserve.</li>\n<li>You don't trust Prince Oargev to do right by Cyrans. He is too beholden to Breland, so you will take matters into your own hands to help yourselves, and any other Cyrans that can see what you are doing.</li>\n<li>You survived the Day of Mourning by being at sea, and have been here in the Lhazaar for a long time now. The law here is that you keep what you take. This has just finally started to rub off. Why not do this for Cyrans?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regardless of your reasons, the most important thing to keep in mind when creating your character is that piracy plays a significant role in this campaign, and your character should be willing on some level to engage in it. Whether you are pirates with or without honor makes no difference. It also does not matter if you are just interested in plundering wealth just for self or for other Cyrans, raiding, overthrowing an existing prince, or finding land for a new home for Cyre. All these options have a place in this campaign, and you get to decide what that is. Outside of there being piracy, there is no intention to force you players into being a certian kind of pirate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":4},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_sfbrzx24rkb","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Player Character Guide","color":"#000000"}}}

He’s always furious about something, but somehow her rage simmers like a stew, and even when she loses her temper she quickly seems to gain control again. A sadist and bully, Lagraa has had a hard, desperate life—few places are more dangerous to grow up than the dockside streets of the Shackles. Only 21 years of age, the memories and scars of Lagraa’s formative years are very fresh, and now she intends to have her revenge.</p>\n<p>Lagraa is also incredibly ambitious—he intends to captain her own ship someday, and she joined the crew of the <em>Storm Reaver</em> purely for her own ends. Thanks to her ruthless devotion to Prince Rockface’s orders, her rise has been meteoric. In just 11 months aboard the <em>Storm Reaver</em>, she has wormed, blackmailed, and murdered her way to the position of first mate, in truth a job well beyond her abilities. she masks her own inadequacies by pointing out those of others.</p>\n<p>Everyone on board the <em>Storm Reaver</em> knows that the first mate is the captain’s right hand when it comes to dealing with the ship’s crew, but Prince Rockface’s other officers form a close inner circle that Lagraa can’t seem to penetrate, a fact that vexes him to no end. Nevertheless, Prince Rockface is sure to punish anyone who attacks Mr. Lagraa, a fact that every member of the crew is acutely aware of.</p>\n<p>To Mister Lagraa, honor, friendship, and teamwork are alien concepts. she believes that discipline is the only thing that matters at sea, and that the constant threat of ruthless punishment is the only thing that can keep a crew of cutthroats and scoundrels in line. she strikes first, and asks questions later. Lagraa is not a forgiving woman, and if someone does get the better of him, Lagraa takes time to plot her revenge in the cruelest way she can think of.</p>\n<p>Bald except for a black ponytail and sporting long, narrow beard, Mister Lagraa somehow looks angry, miserable, and uncomfortable, all at the same time. Bare-chested, she wears an immaculate coat with pearl buttons and carries a cat-o’-nine-tails with him at all times. she clearly takes great pride in himself—everything about him shines, from the polish on her boots to the dome of her head. her teeth are gray and yellow, however, and her face is fixed in an almost constant grimace.</p>\n<h2>Gossip</h2>\n<p>The PCs can learn the following about Mister Lagraa with successful Diplomacy checks to gather information.</p>\n<p>DC 5: If Scourge is a bastard, then Mister Lagraa is her mother and father. One piece of advice—do as she says.</p>\n<p>DC 10: First mate? He’s barely been on board a year! The apple of the captain’s eye, that one. Prince Rockface treats him like a son—but not a legitimate one, of course.</p>\n<p>DC 15: That cutlass of her is magical, see, no doubt about that, and she wields that cat like it was her own arm. I’ve seen him using both in combat. Despite her pettish looks, he’s some fighter by all accounts.</p>\n<p>DC 20: People who cross Lagraa end up dead—stabbed, poisoned, throttled, thrown overboard. Take your pick, they always end up dead. she has friends everywhere, high and low.</p>\n<h2>CampaiGn Role</h2>\n<p>Mister Lagraa (and to a similar extent her repulsive sidekick Master Scourge) presents a challenge for you as GM. she is the main villain of the adventure, yet at the beginning she has considerable inf luence and is practically unassailable. The challenge is to make the PCs loathe him without pushing them to openly attack him, an act that results in keelhauling.</p>\n<p>The penalty for murder on the <em>Storm Reaver</em> should be enough to keep a lid on your player’s desires, but be careful not to overuse her bullying. Lagraa oversees the punishments for infractions on the ship, and does so with relish, but it is Master Scourge, her toadying subordinate, who actually carries out most of the disciplining and poisons the first mate’s mind against the PCs. Again, be careful not to overplay the bullying and sadism, but make sure it is prevalent. With care, you can develop a brooding hatred in your players for this nasty piece of work, and they’ll relish their final encounter with him when the chance eventually presents itself.</p>\n<p>If your players are more unequivocal, however, and likely to bring things to a head before leaving the <em>Storm Reaver</em>, you should bluntly remind them of the consequences of murder.

At the table, adventures often take a step away from the predicted plot, and “The <em>Storm Reaver</em> Mutiny” is no exception. The PCs’ mutiny aboard the Man’s Promise may transpire earlier than is written, or circumstances might dictate that Lagraa and some of her cronies somehow escape. Lagraa is certain to brood upon her lost influence, while avoiding her former captain at all costs. Prince Rockface is certain to be unforgiving if she finds that Lagraa has lost the Man’s Promise and yet still lives. Lagraa limps away and broods on her failure, slowly whispering words to the powerful and great as she plots her revenge. she can appear again as an accomplice of one of the more powerful pirate lords or as a Free Captain in her own right, with a handpicked crew of cutthroats and a dozen disciplinary officers aboard her new ship, the Severe.</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"base","_viewcount":2,"role":"FIrst Mate","location":"The Wormwood","race":"Orc","gender":"","age":"21","eyes":"Green","skin":"","hair":"Black","profession":"","voice":"","faction":"","height":"","weight":"","traits":"","ideals":"","bonds":"","flaws":"","longterm":"","shortterm":"","beliefs":"","secret":"","DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":{"notes":""},"scrollPos":"{\".description\":50}"},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_wu5utkhw5ta","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/The Storm Reaver#/CF_SEP/Crew of the Storm Reaver","color":"#000000"}}}
{"_id":"l1ninIZtPqDvOX4a","name":"Thieves in the Night","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Thieves in the Night</h1>\n<p>One night while sitting at the Red Lantern, the heroes are watched by a man named Kimyun Lee, a Korean from Earth, circa 1750. If one of the player characters seems a shady, sneaky sort, Kimyun approaches with a strange offer.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“You do not know me, but I am a businessman here in Deiking. I have been hired by certain parties to find a person of unparalleled skills in stealth and intrusion. Might you know such a person?”</p>\n</section>\n<p>If the character says yes, or points out another of his crew, Kimyun proceeds.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“There is a junk at the harbor called the King of Siam. I am looking for someone to sneak aboard the ship, locate its bell, steal it, and replace it with a duplicate. All without alerting the crew.</p>\n<p>If you are successful, drop the bell in the rain barrel around back of this very establishment by first light. If it is there in the morning, I will meet you for dinner and pay you your reward. If the crew detects your presence, even if you bring me the bell, I will pay each of you 50 pieces of eight. If you manage it without detection, I will pay you 200 pieces of eight each.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>If Kimyun is questioned about the importance of the bell, he says that it is magical but will not say what powers it possesses. This and the task itself are all a test to see if the crew can be trusted. In fact, the King of Siam is Kimyun’s own ship! Kimyun can offer them a longboat to reach the King if they don’t have one of their own.</p>\n<h3>The King of Siam</h3>\n<p>The Siam is anchored a few hundred yards offshore. It’s a typical junk with a skeleton crew of 15, five of whom are on watch at any given time. The rest are likely gambling and drinking in the hold until they pass out or go to sleep, sometime around the witching hour.</p>\n<p>One man sits on each side, and the fifth lurks in the crow’s nest. The sailors aren’t expecting an intrusion, but are fairly watchful. Use the normal rules for Stealth, and be sure to give the characters bonuses for the darkness (+2) and medium cover (+2). If the sailors spot the thieves, they attack.</p>\n<p>Use typical Sailor statistics for the crew (page 199). Those on watch are armed with muskets and short swords.</p>\n<p>The ship’s bell is located under the main mast. If a character doesn’t specifically indicate he’s muffling the knocker somehow, the bell makes a light sound and three of the five guards get a Notice roll to hear it. If they do, they investigate. The same goes for hanging the replacement bell. Hearing the bell doesn’t mean the heroes are detected, however. The guards must actually see the thieves for them to “fail” in this regard.  Sailors (15): p. 199.</p>\n<h2>Completion</h2>\n<p>If the heroes are successful in retrieving the bell without being seen, Kimyun meets them as promised over dinner the next day. He first pays them their reward—under the table—then whispers the following.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“The bell is not magical. This was merely a test to see if you had the skills to retrieve it, and the trustworthiness to bring it to me. If you are interested in a more dangerous but much more lucrative job, meet me at Tonkan Point tonight at midnight. Come prepared for a similar mission.”</p>\n<p>Tonkan Point is a rocky outcropping a mile south of the main harbor. Kimyun and seven mercenaries are waiting there with his longboat. In the boat is a barrel with bright golden bands.</p>\n<p>“A ship in the harbor was loaded with supplies bound for Kiera today. In its hold are a dozen casks of the purest opium. One of them bears golden bands just like the one in the longboat. I want this barrel in its place.</p>\n<p>The pay is 10,000 pieces of eight. If you accept, I will tell you the name of the ship and you can be on your way. We’ll wait here with your payment.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>If the group agrees, Kimyun continues.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“The ship is the Pan Lung. It normally has a crew of 40, but tonight most are carousing in Deiking and will not be back until morning. Those who remain are well-paid and quite competent, I can assure you.</p>\n<p>There are 18 men aboard the ship. Half will be awake and on duty at any given time. They are commanded by a veteran mercenary named Kang. If they catch you, they will torture you to find out who hired you, then kill you. As you might guess, my name is not really Kimyun, so I have little to fear if you fail other than I will try my plan another day.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>Kimyun has been hired by Kieran rebels to “spike” the Emperor’s opium, hopefully killing him or at least driving him so mad even his own advisors will be forced to put him down. The barrel contains opium laced with other poisons that should do the trick. The cask marked in gold trim is the purest blend, a special present to the Mad Emperor from the Deiking warlords.</p>\n<h2>The Pan Lung</h2>\n<p>This is another typical junk, surprisingly similar to the King of Siam. This time however, two guards sit on each side, and one stands in the crow’s nest. Kang frequently wanders the decks as well. It may be difficult for the heroes to slip into the hold undetected, but this time they can use a distraction if they want. It’s okay if Kang and his guards know they’ve been raided—as long as they don’t realize the Emperor’s opium has been spiked.</p>\n<p>How your group manages to pull off this monumental feat is up to them, of course.</p>\n<p> Guards (18): The 18 crew are Veteran Pirates (p. 195). Kang is a Pirate Captain.</p>\n<h2>Failure</h2>\n<p>If they are discovered, Kang does indeed bind and torture them for all they know. The captain of the ship, Minh Dhai, returns a few hours after first light with some of the crew. He sits in on the torture, makes a report for the warlords, and then waits in harbor for a day for their reply. Most likely, the heroes either spill their guts or die in the process (see below). Once Dhai has all the information he feels he can glean from the prisoners, he sends them to the prison for a public beheading. This occurs 1d4 days later and is a good time to give your heroes a chance to escape.</p>\n<p>Withstanding Kang’s gruesome torture techniques is a Spirit roll at –6 each day. Those who fail tell him everything he wants to know. Clever lies reduce the penalty to –4.</p>\n<h2>Success</h2>\n<p>If the cask is successfully replaced, Kimyun greets them on the shore and pays them the ransom as promised—though he demands they leave Deiking immediately and not return for many months. He’s not above a double-cross if they’ve angered him in some way, but mostly he wants them paid and off the island.</p>\n<p> Kimyun and Guards (50): Use typical Veteran Pirate stats for the mercenaries (p. 195). Treat Kimyun as a Pirate Captain.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_53dtyb3i8lp","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/2.

Even the powerful storm lanterns do little to illuminate the murky gloom. The thick fog muffles the sound of the ship carving through the dark water, and only the faint creaking of timbers breaks the eerie silence.</p>\n<p>Read the following when one or more characters are on watch—preferably when they are alone.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>Although the night is far from warm, you feel the air around you grow noticeably colder. The sudden chill causes you to shiver involuntarily. The hairs on the back of your neck rise and you get the distinct feeling someone is standing behind you—someone who wasn’t there a few seconds ago. A faint whiff of decay reaches your nostrils, causing you to gag.</p>\n</section>\n<p>If the character tries to ignore the strange sensations, the feeling of unease grows steadily stronger. Eventually one of the crew happens by and screams out, pointing behind the character.</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>Standing an arm’s length behind you is a ghastly figure who glows with a cold, pale blue light. It is dressed in the fashion of a Spanish naval captain from the late 18th century, though his clothes appear ragged and worn. Maggots crawl through grisly wounds in its rotting flesh. With a ghastly moan, the figure raises its arm and points at you.</p>\n<p>“I need you,” it hisses in broken English. “You must help me.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>Seeing the ghostly Spaniard calls for a Fear check. Attacking the figure is futile—weapons pass straight through without effect. No matter what the heroes do, the figure just stands on the deck, pointing at the nearest character. Seeing as the ghost makes no threatening gestures, and no doubt wishing it gone, striking a conversation should seem a sensible course of action.</p>\n<h2>The Ghost’s Tale</h2>\n<p>Assuming the party converses with the spirit, it tells its sorrowful tale:</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“My name is Captain Iago Alfonso de Toledo,” he says, his voice resonating in the still air. “I was captain of the Black Prince, a Spanish galleon brought into this world three years ago. My ship arrived in the midst of a terrible storm and floundered. The crew abandoned ship and set out in the longboats. A higher authority had already sealed our fate, for we found no land and one by one my crew died of thirst. Rather than suffer, I threw myself overboard and drowned.</p>\n<p>“Since that day I have wandered as a spirit, unable to find peace. In order to depart to whatever fate awaits me, I must have the locket my wife gave me. Without it I am lost, trapped between existences.</p>\n<p>“I cannot journey beneath the waves, but I can aid you in reaching my ship. She lies a day’s sail from here, on a shelf 20 fathoms deep. Aid me and the treasures my ship carried are yours for the taking.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>Captain Iago seems sincere, but hides a terrible secret—when his vessel sank it was carrying slaves to the Americas. No attempt was made to rescue the slaves, and Iago was cursed to wander Caribdus as a ghost until he found someone to aid him.</p>\n<h2>Reaching the Wreck</h2>\n<p>As Iago stated, the wreck of his ship lies a day’s sail from the party’s present location. Iago can pinpoint its location with supernatural accuracy.</p>\n<p>The wreck lies in 20 fathoms of water, on the bottom of a shelf. Getting down to the wreck without the use of the environmental protection power is next to impossible. Luckily, Iago can imbue characters with the power simply by touching them. Unfortunately, he cannot extend the duration beyond an hour. Travel to and from the wreck takes a total of 20 minutes, leaving the group 40 minutes to explore.</p>\n<p>Although the power lets heroes move at their full Pace, armor still subtracts its protection value from Swimming rolls underwater. Leather armor also weighs twice as much when wet (which may affect encumbrance totals).</p>\n<p>As the characters make their descent, have them make sight based Notice rolls. Those who succeed spot maneater sharks (one per 2 heroes), darting toward the group out of the murky depths.</p>\n<p> Maneater Sharks (1 per 2 Heroes): p. 200.</p>\n<h2>The Black Prince</h2>\n<p>The ship suffered badly during the storm—the bow has shattered, its timbers dispersed over a wide area, leaving only the stern remaining. Rusty cannons and cannonballs lie in the silt where they fell. Entrance to the ship can be gained through the mid-section, which lies open. The name of the ship is no longer visible. Aside from the following areas, there is nothing of value on the vessel.</p>\n<p>Hold: Within the hold are the remains of 30 slaves, each manacled to the wall by a heavy chain. One of the skeletons is considerably larger than the others—this is the remains of Benga Mamoto’s brother, Machawi.</p>\n<p> Booty: Benga rewards the group with a charm bracelet if the skeleton is returned to him. The bracelet protects the wearer from evil spirits and grants +2 Armor against supernatural or magical attacks.</p>\n<p>Iago’s Cabin: Much of the furnishings remain, including the captain’s tarred sea chest. The corpses of several crewmembers lie on the floor, their tattered flesh food for numerous fishes.</p>\n<p> Zombies (1 per Hero): p. 203.</p>\n<p> Booty: The chest contains charts and papers, a silver portrait containing a miniature portrait of a dark haired woman, and 500 pieces of eight.</p>\n<p>Opening the chest underwater ruins the captain’s charts and papers. If kept dry, the papers reveal Iago’s business transactions, detailing slave shipments over many years and listing as many as 50% casualties among his cargo on some voyages. The charts are useless, showing the Americas rather than Caribdus, but are worth $200 to a collector such as Jose-Maria Caballeros (page 88).</p>\n<p>If the heroes try to leave with the locket—in or out of the chest—the corpses animate as zombies. Iago’s crew, subjected to the torment of being undead, has no wish for their captain to find salvation.</p>\n<h2>Redemption</h2>\n<p>Once the heroes return to their ship, Iago rushes up to them, demanding the locket and making all manner of threats if refused. Fortunately for the heroes he cannot harm them (part of his curse), nor can he take the locket by force—it must be given to him freely.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the characters hand over the locket is a personal choice. Iago willfully and knowingly left his “cargo” to die when his ship floundered, thus bringing the curse on himself and his crew.</p>\n<p>If the locket is handed over, Iago clutches it to his chest, thanks the heroes, and vanishes, never to be seen again. Should they refuse, Iago emits an anguished cry and fades from view, vowing revenge in the next life. Iago is tied to his ship but not the locket—a particularly cruel revenge is to sail away and throw the locket overboard at some random point in the journey, forever denying him peace.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_53dtyb3i8lp","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/2.

If a character succeeds at a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Performance]{Performance} check, he gains a +1 bonus per @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} to social checks made to interact with any listener among the crew for the next 24 hours, up to a maximum of +4. A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure}, however, indicates that the next time he attempts to use @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Performance]{Performance} to entertain the crew, everyone ignores him.</p>\n<h3>Gambling Games</h3>\n<p>Other recreations have two things in common: they are dangerous, and they are played for money. When betting on any of the following games, the minimum bet is 1 gp, and the maximum ready cash any sailor in the lesser crew is likely to have is 20 gp. Some people are bad losers—the ramifications of this are left for the GM to decide.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Arm Wrestling:</strong> Not merely typical arm wrestling bouts, such matches are usually conducted on a barrel top covered in broken glass, knives, or caltrops. Participants make opposed @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Strength} checks, with the higher result determining the winner, and the loser taking an level of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} from @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bumps and Bruises]{Bumps and Bruises} as his hand and arm are pushed onto whatever lies on the table.</li>\n<li><strong>Hog Lob: </strong>Participants lob a lead ingot covered in a greased piglet skin, the “hog,” as far across the deck as possible. This game is resolved by @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} checks between any number of players, who agree on a bet beforehand. The hog counts as an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Improvised Weapons]{improvised weapon}. Some pirates claim to have participated in games played against Devourer using a live hog.</li>\n<li><strong>Heave:</strong> This potentially deadly drinking game is played with rum and takes place between any number of pirates, who bet to predict the winner beforehand. Each pirate drinks a half pint of rum in one swig. Doing so forces participants to make a successful @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Traits]{Vigor} check –1 or take a level of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}. This check increases by –1 for each consecutive drink. Pirates then take turns drinking until only one is left standing. Some tales tell of entire crews drinking themselves to death through this game, leaving ships of drunk ghosts wandering the shipping routes.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_f5h8exvluwf","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/Ship lore","color":"#000000"}}}
{"_id":"uMiAoyZLIMEFFICD","name":"Debauchery","content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\">\n<h1 class=\"wide\">Debauchery</h1>\n<p>Mannie Morkan is a proud citizen of Ograpog who despises the Baltimus’ family for deserting King Amemnus in his hour of need. He has said so in public many times—enough so that Bruno Baltimus secretly invited Morkan’s daughter to one of his after-hours parties. The starstruck 17-year old girl foolishly accepted the invitation. The next morning, Morrie was left dazed and abused on Morkan’s doorstep. The message was clear.</p>\n<h3>Morkan’s Revenge</h3>\n<p>Morkan pretended to back down, but in truth his anger seethes like a boiling teapot. The merchant now seeks an assassin—one with the stomach to slaughter Bruno and his entire group of rakes as they defile themselves at one of their midnight soirées.</p>\n<p>How Morkan learns of the player characters is up to you. They must be of a somewhat tarnished disposition and quite capable to be approached by the mad father. They must also be somewhat charming, for Morkan’s plan is for them to gain Bruno Baltimus’ trust and then betray him.</p>\n<p>When Mannie is finally ready to make his offer, he approaches the crew and drops a piece of paper in their hands. On the paper is a single word— Versalis. A Common Knowledge roll at –2 (–4 to visitors) allows a hero to remember this as a legendary masaquani sword, equivalent to Earth’s Excalibur.</p>\n<p>Assuming the party follows Morkan outside, he says the following:</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“I’m looking for agents of vengeance. Men and women who aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty. Very dirty. I’m looking for curs who can pretend to be a man’s best friend and then gut him from behind when he turns his back. If I can find such hirelings, and if they avenge my family, I will pass on a treasure unlike any they have ever seen.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>Morkan is taking a bit of a risk here—the crew could simply beat him until he revealed the location of Versalis. His daughter, Morrie, watches from a dark corner beyond, but can do little but scream if the crew attempts to attack her father. Even this is a risk because the sailors could reveal what Mannie said to Baltimus, which would almost certainly result in his and his daughter’s death.</p>\n<p>Mannie is desperate now though. He’s sick and knows he won’t live much longer. His daughter cannot wield Versalis, and he has no other living kin to give it to, so this is his final gift to his family. It’s all or nothing.</p>\n<h3>The Mark</h3>\n<p>If the heroes agree to Mannie’s offer, he bows his head, grits his teeth, and says: “Do you know who Bruno Baltimus is?” That should be enough to make most characters think twice about this assignment. Bruno Baltimus is the son of Byron Baltimus, the founder of the city and one of the founders of the Great Harbor system itself. If the group seems undaunted, however, Mannie continues:</p>\n<section class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>“What the father did to the King of Ograpog was treason. What he did to this city makes my skin crawl. What his son and his rakes did to my daughter makes my blood boil.</p>\n<p>I have forged invitations to Bruno’s next gala in three days. I want you to go to the party and find a way to make him invite you to his after hours debauchery. The one he throws after the other guests leave. While he and his friends defile themselves, I want you to strike. Kill them all. I don’t care if they suffer or not, I just want them dead, dead, DEAD!”</p>\n</section>\n<p>Mannie is visibly shaking by this point. Spit flies from his lips and his skin turns red as a beet. If the crew agrees, Morkan hands over a blank invitation for one person and his “entourage.” The party is to be held three nights from tonight.</p>\n<h3>Baltimus Manor</h3>\n<p>The Manor is a huge marble building on the high cliffs of Baltimus. The gala begins with a feast around dinner time (6 bells) and continues until 11 bells or so. At that point the doors are closed and the staff begins to clean.</p>\n<p>Bruno and a dozen of his closest friends plus twice that number of young women head into the heir’s parlor upstairs, a maze of thin, oriental-style partitions hiding numerous beds, hookahs, liquor, and erotic paintings. A trio of musicians even plays soft and suggestive music from behind one of the walls.</p>\n<p>Getting invited to this soiree requires some serious roleplaying as well as a few key Persuasion rolls. Fellow hunters, nobles, and playboys fit well with Bruno and his band, as do attractive women.</p>\n<p>The activities start with wine and dancing and quickly descend into depravity from there.</p>\n<p>If the player characters are part of the debauchery, they can simply grab their weapons and do as they will. The exterior walls of the room are quite thick, so even gunshots aren’t likely to rouse the estate’s guards as long as the doors remain shut and the large window overhead remains intact.</p>\n<p>Bruno tries to fight at first, but as soon as he realizes he’s outnumbered he rallies behind some of his surviving rakes, then suddenly abandons them and leaps for the staircase yelling “Guards!” A dozen guards arrive wherever Bruno is 1d6 rounds after they hear his yell.</p>\n<p>If the assassins weren’t invited to the party, they’ll need to break in somehow, perhaps posing as servants or simply sneaking through the house somehow.</p>\n<p>Bruno has five guards posted inside the house, and another dozen circle the grounds outside.</p>\n<p>Guards (17): Use veteran City Watch (p. 184) for the 17 guards stationed around the manor.</p>\n<p>Rakes (13): Bruno and his twelve friends are athletic outdoorsmen. Use City Watch statistics (p. 184) for the lecherous nobles. Bruno is a Wild Card.</p>\n<p>Booty: The heroes have just enough time to gather a King’s Ransom.</p>\n<h3>Aftermath</h3>\n<p>What happens next depends on the assassins’ actions. The British East India Company puts out a $10,000 bounty on the killers. Everywhere the group goes, they are hunted and hounded. Even after they leave Baltimus, they are likely to be found as news of the deed spreads around Caribdus. Both good souls and greedy ones partake in the chase, hoping to bring these foul killers to justice—and collect the reward.</p>\n<p>Byron’s Diary: If the heroes are here to find Byron’s diary, they do so after slaying Bruno. If they try to talk him into giving them his father’s records, he agrees if convinced that it will save the world (a Persuasion roll at –2).</p>\n<p>Versalis: Mannie Morkan lives up to his promise. He meets the group at their preappointed spot and gives them Versalis, one of the most powerful swords in Caribdus.</p>\n<p>Versalis: Anytime the wielder of Versalis hits with a raise, the foe must make a Vigor roll at –2 or be beheaded and die instantly. The magic works on any living creature of Size –2 to +2 that has a discernible head.</p>\n</div>\n","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":1},"cf":{"id":"temp_53dtyb3i8lp","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/2.

Growing up among pirates is tough for anyone unusual, and Grok got her scar fighting a gang of cutthroats in the alleys of @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Port Verge]{Port Verge} who robbed her and left her for dead when she was only 11 years old. Grok is a reedy half-orc who favors dark clothing. She carries a notched greataxe and an array of throwing axes hangs from her belt. Grok frequently grins toothily, and uses appalling curse words, particularly when drunk. Grok is renowned for being tough, and she doesn’t suffer fools, but she is a close friend of Ambrose Kroop, whom she sees as someone who’s had even worse luck than she’s had.</p>\n<p>Grok is usually found in the quartermaster’s store (area A9) during the day. In the evenings, she locks the store and carouses on deck, drinking and gambling with the other pirates before returning to her cabin (area A7) to sleep it off.</p>\n<p>Grok loves unusual drink and fine songs, and a character who provides her with at least 20 gp worth of alcohol that isn’t rum or who makes a successful DC 15 Perform (song) check gains a +4 bonus on all checks made to influence her. If Grok is made friendly, she allows the PCs into the quartermaster’s store after normal hours, where PCs can negotiate for equipment with her with additional Diplomacy checks. Recovering a PC’s starting equipment is considered simple aid (DC +0), a loan of goods worth up to 150 gp is considered lengthy aid (DC +5), and a loan of 300 gp worth of equipment is considered dangerous aid that could result in punishment, since she might get keelhauled herself for theft (DC +15).</p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-adventures/pirates-of-cyre/icons/pirates-of-cyre.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_viewcount":4,"type":"base","role":"Quartermaster","location":"The Wormwood","race":"Female Half-Orc","gender":"","age":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":"","profession":"","voice":"Gravelly","faction":"","height":"","weight":"","traits":"","ideals":"","bonds":"","flaws":"","longterm":"","shortterm":"","beliefs":"","secret":"","DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":{"notes":""},"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_wu5utkhw5ta","path":"Mourners of Lhazaar#/CF_SEP/The Storm Reaver#/CF_SEP/Crew of the Storm Reaver","color":"#000000"}}}
