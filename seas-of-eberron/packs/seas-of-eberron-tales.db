They all remember the night before&mdash;the ringing laughter of a wild night, the heady joy of excess, the scents of rich stewed meat and perfume lingering in their nostrils. Then describe the sensations that the PCs feel&mdash;a pounding headache, the sickly taste of cheap wine in their mouths, the hard f loor, a rhythmic creaking noise, and the feeling of the room swaying, as if they were still drunk. Before the PCs can do much more than sit up, however, several pairs of heavy footsteps enter the dark room, and the harsh light of a lantern painfully spears the PCs&rsquo; eyes.</p>\n<p>Creatures: Master Scourge, the Wormwood&rsquo;s boatswain, master-at-arms, and infamous disciplinarian, has entered the hold to wake the PCs and get them up to the main deck. Six rough-looking Wormwood pirates, armed with saps, accompany him. An expression that might be mistaken for pain but which is clearly an attempt at a smile bruises Scourge&rsquo;s face as he cracks the whip in his hand and screams at the PCs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Still abed with the sun over the yardarm? On your feet, ye filthy swabs! Get up on deck and report for duty before Cap&rsquo;n Harrigan flays your flesh into sausage skins and has Fishguts fry ye up for breakfast!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The PCs quickly discover that most, if not all, of their weapons and equipment are gone (see below). If the PCs refuse, even momentarily, to accompany Scourge, he lashes out at any offending PCs with his whip. If necessary, he calls for aid from the pirates, who attack uncooperative characters with their saps. It should be immediately clear to the PCs that if they don&rsquo;t cooperate, they will quickly be overpowered. Scourge and the pirates herd the PCs up through the middle deck (area A6) and onto the Wormwood&rsquo;s main deck (area A3) to meet the ship&rsquo;s captain.</p>\n<p>As the PCs make their way to the main deck, they can begin to adjust to their surroundings and deduce what happened to them. A DC 10 Perception check discerns the aftertaste of oily nutmeg on the tongue. A DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check or DC 10 Knowledge (nature) check recognizes this as a clear sign of oil of taggit poisoning (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 560). Each PC remembers indulging in either spicy food or spicy rum late last night, and those who made the above checks realize that the oil was likely added to their food or drink, and the Master Scourge spices hid the taste of the taggit oil. Any PCs who make a DC 10 Intelligence check remember seeing the face of Master Scourge last night as well, and can piece together the facts outlined above.</p>\n<p>Development: If the PCs decide to fight, Master Scourge and the pirates attack, attempting to disarm the PCs of any weapons they might have concealed and subdue them with nonlethal damage. The pirates will not the kill the PCs, however. Once the pirates have the upper hand (with the help of additional crew, if necessary), they take the PCs&mdash;conscious or unconscious&mdash;to the main deck, where they get an immediate taste of punishment on the Wormwood. The PCs are tied to the mainmast, and Master Scourge gives each of them three lashes before the captain&rsquo;s address. See &ldquo;The Life of a Pirate&rdquo; on page 60 for details of punishments on a pirate ship.</p>\n<h2>Meeting the Captain</h2>\n<p>When the PCs reach the main deck, either of their own volition or under duress, it&rsquo;s quickly apparent that they are on a sizable ship in the middle of the ocean, far from any land. Port Peril and the mainland of the Shackles are just an ochre haze many miles astern. Figures cluster around the ship&rsquo;s mainmast, looking up at the higher deck on the stern, where two figures stand. One of them is a broad, muscular Garundi man with a shaven head, a long beard bound with gold rings, and an eye patch&mdash; clearly the captain. The other is a younger, balding man with a long black ponytail, wearing a long coat and carrying a well-used cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails.</p>\n<p>At this point the PCs also notice that they are not the only new recruits&mdash;four others are standing with them on the deck, set apart by their relative cleanliness and their apparent unease with their newfound situation. A dozen or so other pirates, clearly existing members of the crew, stand about on the deck or in the ship&rsquo;s rigging. Once the PCs are on deck, the captain addresses the crew.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Glad you could join us at last! Welcome to the Wormwood! My thanks for &lsquo;volunteering&rsquo; to join my crew. I&rsquo;m Barnabas Harrigan. That&rsquo;s Captain Barnabas Harrigan to you, not that you&rsquo;ll ever need to address me. I have only one rule&mdash;don&rsquo;t speak to me. I like talk, but I don&rsquo;t like your talk. Follow that rule and we&rsquo;ll all get along fine.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, and one more thing. Even with you new recruits, we&rsquo;re still short-handed, and I aim to keep what crew I have. There&rsquo;ll be a keelhaulin&rsquo; for anyone caught killin&rsquo; anyone. Mr. Plugg! If you&rsquo;d be so kind as to make pirates out of these landlubbers, it&rsquo;ll save me having to put them in the sweatbox for a year and a day before I make pies out of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At the end of his speech, the captain walks away, leaving behind the man with the cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails. This is Mister Plugg, the Wormwood&rsquo;s first mate. He looks down at the PCs and other impressed captives and smiles unpleasantly. Plugg has no time for small talk or pleasantries. His intention is to get the new recruits working on the ship as soon as possible. He immediately begins his own unique and cunning evaluations to test the PCs&rsquo; abilities. Mr. Plugg is introduced on page 20.</p>\n<h2>Mr. Plugg's Tests</h2>\n<p>After Harrigan&rsquo;s recent difficulties, the Wormwood is seriously undermanned, and Mr. Plugg has a number of positions to fill on the ship. Whether or not the PCs are ideal candidates does not concern him in the slightest, as he assigns jobs first, then worries about making the PCs fit their roles afterward. Plugg is not remotely interested in who the PCs believe is best, or whether, for example, the best climber makes a couple of bad rolls and loses out to a lucky non-climber. The PCs can deliberately try to fail a test, however, by making a Bluff check opposed by Plugg&rsquo;s Sense Motive skill to get away with it. If the check fails, Plugg smells a rat and immediately gives that PC three lashes with the cat (see page 66) as punishment.</p>\n<p>Plugg&rsquo;s first test is to see how good the PCs are at climbing, as he needs another sailor to work in the rigging. He instructs the PCs to climb to the crow&rsquo;s nest on the mainmast above the main deck as fast as they can, coldly cursing them if they hesitate, and cruelly taunting them if they fall. Climbing the rigging requires a DC 10 Climb check to reach the crow&rsquo;s nest, 60 feet above the deck. Remember that the PCs climb at one-quarter their normal speeds (or half speed with an accelerated climb) so each PC will need to make several Climb checks. The first PC to reach the crow&rsquo;s nest is the winner. In the event of a tie, the PC with the highest final Climb check is the winner. PCs who refuse the test are whipped by Scourge until they climb. The PC who wins this test is told that he or she is now a rigger, and works directly for Plugg, who assigns that PC the first day&rsquo;s duties at the conclusion of the second test.</p>\n<p>Plugg&rsquo;s second test is one of necessity&mdash;he knows the ship&rsquo;s cook, Ambrose &ldquo;Fishguts&rdquo; Kroop, has a drinking problem, and he&rsquo;s fed up with eating rubbish. This test is simple: Plugg asks each PC in turn whether they can cook, and if one of them says yes, that PC becomes the new cook&rsquo;s mate. If Plugg gets to the end of the line without an affirmative answer, he simply picks the fattest PC (Plugg assumes that character likes food the most) and says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cook&rsquo;s mate now,&rdquo; and tells that PC to report to Ambrose Kroop in the galley (area A8). If more than one person claims to be a good cook, Plugg picks the fattest.</p>\n<p>The remaining PCs are all assigned to be swabs, under the command of Master Scourge, who immediately gets them working. See A Pirate&rsquo;s Day on page 22 for details on the tasks associated with the PCs&rsquo; new jobs. For the cook&rsquo;s mate, see page 21 for details on that PC&rsquo;s first meeting with Ambrose Kroop.</p>\n<h2>A Keelhauling</h2>\n<p>Work: The PCs spend the day at their assigned jobs. In addition, each PC can take a single daytime ship action.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Bloody Hour&rdquo;: The crew gathers on deck at dusk to witness the keelhauling of Jakes Magpie, a pirate caught stealing from the quartermaster&rsquo;s store the night before. After a brief interrogation at the hands of Mr. Plugg and Master Scourge, Jakes admitted his crime, and is now brought up from the bilges (area A11) to be slowly keelhauled before the evening meal. A DC 15 Perception check notices the relish with which Mr. Plugg, in particular, tugs at the rope as the unfortunate Magpie is dragged under the ship for 12 rounds. What appears on the other side has been cut to shreds and is soon thrown overboard to feed the sharks. A PC who examines the body before it is dumped can make a DC 15 Heal check to estimate that the unfortunate Jakes took about 24 points of damage from the punishment and drowned as well. Witnessing Jakes&rsquo;s keelhauling should help impress upon the players the deadly nature of pirate punishments.</p>\n<p>Leisure: After dinner and the rum rations, various pirate entertainments (see page 67) take place on deck or below, for as long as people are sober enough to participate. In addition, each PC can take a single nighttime ship action.</p>\n<p>Rest: Provided they&rsquo;ve drunk their rum rations, the PCs can retire to their hammocks in the lower hold (area A10) whenever they wish. The PCs can take additional nighttime ship actions if they have the energy</p>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"dqrNlUN1O2ssKAzE"}

He is Captain Redeker&rsquo;s second-in-command, and his word is law on deck. He takes an immediate dislike to the PCs and any friends they make among the crew. Dabrak is terrified of Captain Redeker, however, and has more things on his mind than just the PCs. He&rsquo;s suspicious of everyone on the crew, and while he grows to hate the PCs, he does not sully his hands with fighting them unless they attack him, in which case he fights with relish, calling on his allies for aid in dealing with the &ldquo;mutineers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dabrak is a figure to be hated, though the PCs have little opportunity to get their revenge at first. By the end of the adventure, however, the PCs finally have the opportunity to give him (and his toady, Master Scourge) their just rewards.</p>\n<h3>Master Scourge</h3>\n<p>Master Scourge is the Wormwood&rsquo;s boatswain and masterat-arms, and Mr. Plugg&rsquo;s right-hand man. As boatswain, he is in charge of all activities and sailors on deck, and as master-at-arms, he is responsible for discipline. Master Scourge is a sneering man with a braided beard and a mouth full of gold teeth. His body is tall and thin, and even his long coat and heavy boots fail to give any impression of strength or bulk. A sadistic coward, Scourge uses his association with Plugg as protection and in return has no morals when it comes to the tasks his master sets. He is bold and violent when the odds are stacked in his favor, happily kicking a dying dog in the street if asked to do so. But should that dog get up and bite, he quickly f lees.</p>\n<p>Master Scourge is a key villain in the early part of the adventure, and his whispered words further poison Mr. Plugg against the PCs. Scourge&rsquo;s relationship with the PCs is a crucial one. He immediately senses something out of the ordinary about them, and his dreams of rank and fortune soon begin to unravel. Like most bullies, Scourge is a coward at heart, and sets out to discredit and ultimately kill his rivals.</p>\n<p>This enmity is personal, and primarily directed at a single PC, though how this manifests is ultimately up to you. Scourge was recently rejected by Sandara Quinn (see page 56), and any object of her affections is sure to earn his jealousy and hatred. Likewise, Scourge might be jealous of a handsome and talented PC and fear for his own position on the ship. While Scourge focuses his hostility on one PC, he is also happy to intimidate and victimize the other PCs, as well as seeking to discredit the PCs&rsquo; friends. He avoids the PCs as a group, however, and immediately goes to Plugg&rsquo;s side if threatened. If actually attacked, he also goes to Plugg, who may have the PCs disciplined.</p>\n<p>Playing the bully requires you to temper the PCs&rsquo; anger while ensuring they recognize Scourge as a deadly enemy with far too many allies to simply be killed. Terrified as he is of Harrigan and having no desire to be keelhauled, Scourge won&rsquo;t try to kill the PCs&mdash;at least, not at first. Instead, he seeks to poison the other crew members against the PCs, and is likely to succeed with his own small band of admirers, whom the PCs will find hard to convert. In essence, this group becomes a rival adventuring party, but with one crucial difference: these rivals also enjoy the support of Mr. Plugg.

His job is to bring the ship&rsquo;s biscuit on deck at dawn for the crew, and prepare and serve the evening meal. Kroop is a drunkard, but not constantly inebriated, and is a potential ally for the PCs. His unpredictability makes him a frustrating but ultimately useful friend. Like his friend Cut-Throat Grok, Kroop is from the school of hard knocks, but where Grok has become tough, Kroop has capitulated in the face of endless discipline and violence. However, as the adventure progresses and he becomes closer to the PCs, he becomes an increasingly useful ally.</p>\n<p>While Kroop is indifferent to the PCs at the beginning of the adventure, he is, at heart, a friendly salt, and soon becomes attached to any character who makes a modicum of effort as the cook&rsquo;s mate. In general, Kroop likes to cook and drink rum. He is usually insensibly drunk in his quarters during the evening, rarely venturing onto deck after serving the evening meal. Kroop&rsquo;s cook&rsquo;s mate gains a +2 bonus on all checks to inf luence the quartermaster Cut-Throat Grok. Kroop is also happy to lend his mate any equipment from the galley, though stealing it without his permission is easy enough.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"vOAnxYqtNxkbYqNX"}

Kroop is also happy to lend his mate any equipment from the galley, though stealing it without his permission is easy enough.</p>\n<h3>Cut-Throat Grok</h3>\n<p>Cut-Throat Grok is the <em>Wormwood&rsquo;s </em>quartermaster, a no-nonsense character with a huge scar across her neck. Growing up among pirates is tough for anyone unusual, and Grok got her scar fighting a gang of cutthroats in the alleys of Port Peril who robbed her and left her for dead when she was only 11 years old. Grok is a reedy half-orc who favors dark clothing. She carries a notched greataxe and an array of throwing axes hangs from her belt. Grok frequently grins toothily, and uses appalling curse words, particularly when drunk. Grok is renowned for being tough, and she doesn&rsquo;t suffer fools, but she is a close friend of Ambrose Kroop, whom she sees as someone who&rsquo;s had even worse luck than she&rsquo;s had.</p>\n<p>Grok is usually found in the quartermaster&rsquo;s store (area A9) during the day. In the evenings, she locks the store and carouses on deck, drinking and gambling with the other pirates before returning to her cabin (area A7) to sleep it off.</p>\n<p>Grok loves unusual drink and fine songs, and a character who provides her with at least 20 gp worth of alcohol that isn&rsquo;t rum or who makes a successful DC 15 Perform (song) check gains a +4 bonus on all checks made to inf luence her. If Grok is made friendly, she allows the PCs into the quartermaster&rsquo;s store after normal hours, where PCs can negotiate for equipment with her with additional Diplomacy checks. Recovering a PC&rsquo;s starting equipment is considered simple aid (DC +0), a loan of goods worth up to 150 gp is considered lengthy aid (DC +5), and a loan of 300 gp worth of equipment is considered dangerous aid that could result in punishment, since she might get keelhauled herself for theft (DC +15).</p>\n<h3>Other Officers</h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">In addition to the major NPCs detailed on these pages, a number of other officers serve aboard the </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Wormwood</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Although most of these characters play little or no role in this adventure and cannot be inf luenced, the PCs may spot them aboard the ship or hear about them from their fellow pirates.

A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure}, however, indicates that the next time he attempts to use @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Performance]{Performance} to entertain the crew, everyone ignores him.</p>\n<h3>Gambling Games</h3>\n<p>Other recreations have two things in common: they are dangerous, and they are played for money.

The following presents (in order of severity) the game effects of a variety of typical nautical punishments, which the PCs have the potential to face or inflict during their piratical careers. Most of these sentences are meted out just before the evening meal, at an event typically referred to as the bloody hour. Victims are tied to the whipping post on the main deck and their backs stripped for punishment&mdash;with penalties doubled for those who resist.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Rope Bash</h3>\n<p>Little more than an admonishment&mdash;and occasionally used as a sign of endearment&mdash;a rope bash is a single attack with the hefty, sealed end of a ship&rsquo;s rope.</p>\n<h3>The Lash</h3>\n<p>This is an attack using a whip. Lashes during bloody hour is typically just cause one level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}.</p>\n<h3>Cat-o&rsquo;-Nine-Tails</h3>\n<p>This is an attack using a cat-o&rsquo;-ninetails, also referred to simply as a cat&mdash;lashes with the cat cause one level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}.</p>\n<h3>Confined in the Sweatbox</h3>\n<p>A cramped metal box left on deck and exposed to the sun, a sweatbox is terribly confining and replicates unbearably hot conditions. Each four hours in the sweatbox the victim must make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Vigor} at &ndash;1 for each 8 hours they spend in the sweat box, or suffer a level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}. Any creature with fire resistance is immune to the effects of the sweatbox. Victims typically spend 8, 12 or even 24 hours locked up in the sweatbox.</p>\n<h3>Keelhauling</h3>\n<p>The most frightful of pirate punishments is keelhauling, as it generally ends in death&mdash;often by decapitation. Being keelhauled involves being tied to a rope looped over a ship&rsquo;s keel and dragged down one side of a ship, underwater across the barnacle encrusted hull, and up the other side. Keelhauling can be done either fast or slow. If done fast, the barnacles cut deep and flense the victim, dealing 2d6 points of damage per round. If done slow, shallower cuts are incurred, dealing 1d6 damage per round, but the risk of drowning increases. How long keelhauling takes typically depends on the vessel, with a keelhauling on a ship like the Wormwood taking 6 rounds if done fast and 12 rounds if done slow.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"fC1md8BUCs6FEXX3"}
{"name":"Ship Roles","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_82mnriint6m","path":"Seas of Eberron Tales#/CF_SEP/The Wormwood","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Ship Roles</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>All crew members on any ship have specific roles and responsibilities, often with harsh punishments being meted out upon those who shirk their duties. Listed here are some of the standard roles aboard a typical ship. Not all of these roles might be represented on every vessel, but such details can help players understand their characters&rsquo; daily duties.</p>\n<h3>Artificer/Mage</h3>\n<p>Many ships that ply the waters around Khorvaire have an artificer or mage on board. They can be responsible for the functioning of any magical locomotion of the ship, repairs, general arcane knowledge or any number of other magical needs the ship might have. They are also expected to contribute firepower to any ship to ship conflicts that happen on the vessel.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Boatswain</h3>\n<p>The boatswain, or bosun (pronounced &ldquo;bosun&rdquo; either way), is responsible for the upper deck of the vessel and above. This makes the boatswain accountable for all rope, rigging, anchors, and sails. At the start of the day, the boatswain and those under her weigh anchor, raise the sails and report on the general condition of the ship&rsquo;s deck to the captain. As she oversees many of the ship&rsquo;s basic daily labors, the boatswain is often responsible for keeping discipline and dispensing punishment.</p>\n<h3>Cabin Boy/Girl</h3>\n<p>Servant to the captain and other officers, this low-ranking and typically young crew member assists other sailors in their duties and runs various errands across the ship, requiring him or her to gain a measure of understanding of almost all the ship&rsquo;s roles.</p>\n<h3>Captain</h3>\n<p>The ultimate authority on any ship, his word is law to all on board. The captain chooses where to sail, what are fitting punishments for breeches in discipline,&nbsp; and who fills the other stations aboard the vessel, among many other command decisions. Leadership can prove perilous, however, as a captain is, above all, meant to secure success for his ship and crew. Failing to do so increases the threat of mutiny.</p>\n<h3>Carpenter</h3>\n<p>No matter what enchantments or alchemical unguents augment a pirate ship, its heart and bones are still wood. This simple fact makes the carpenter one of the most important positions aboard any vessel. Carpenters are chief ly responsible for maintaining the ship below the deck, finding and plugging leaks, repairing damage, and replacing masts and yards.</p>\n<h3>Cook</h3>\n<p>While the quartermaster normally allocates the rations, the cook and his apprentices make and distribute meals to the crew. Although some better-outfitted vessels employ skilled cooks to attend to the captain and the officers, many cooks are drawn from crew members who have suffered crippling injuries, allowing them to still serve even after such trauma.</p>\n<h3>Healer</h3>\n<p>Many ships have a healer on board to tend to any injuries that happen. Whether this is a House Jorasco healer, Jorasco trained, or some herbalist with slight training in healing, depends on the vessel.</p>\n<h3>Master-at-Arms</h3>\n<p>Concerned with the security of the ship, the fitness of the crew, and the dispensing of justice, the master-at-arms typically is one of the most feared and dreaded of a ship&rsquo;s officers.</p>\n<h3>Master Gunner</h3>\n<p>The master gunner is in charge of all shipboard artillery, ensuring the weapons are kept in good working order and that the crew knows how to use them. She maintains the ballistas, catapults, and so on.</p>\n<h3>Quartermaster</h3>\n<p>The quartermaster oversees the supplies and items stored aboard the ship. She maintains the supplies of food and weaponry, oversees the disbursement of food to the cook, and doles out the rum ration to the crew.</p>\n<h3>Rigger</h3>\n<p>Riggers work the rigging and unfurl the sails. In battle, next to that of a boarding party, the riggers&rsquo; job is one of the most dangerous, as they pull enemy vessels near enough to board.</p>\n<h3>Swab</h3>\n<p>Any sailor who mops the decks. Also used as slang for any low-ranking or unskilled crew member.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"5V9D8GBF7XMcBNMP"}

However, a failed check is likely to elicit a violent response from the angry sailor.</p>\n<p><strong>Sador Chumlett</strong><br /><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Stat:</strong></em></span> Male orc, <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Job:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;swab,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Intial reaction:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;unfriendly<br />A fat, pushy bully with a shaved head.</p>\n<p><strong>Jaundiced Sudak</strong><br /><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Stat:</strong></em></span> Female dwarf, <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Job:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;swab,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Intial reaction:</strong></em></span> hostile<br />A humorless, greedy mute.</p>\n<p><strong>Maheem</strong><br /><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Stat:</strong></em></span> Male human, <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Job:</strong></em></span> rigger, <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Intial reaction:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;hostile<br />A big man with a permanent scowl.</p>\n<p><strong>Slippery Syl</strong><br /><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Stat:</strong></em></span> Male dwarf, <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Job:</strong></em></span> rigger, <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Intial reaction:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;hostile<br />An unhinged murderer who fled to sea to escape the gallows.</p>\n<p><strong>Tam \"Narwhal\" Tate</strong><br /><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Stat:</strong></em></span> Male dwarf, <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Job:</strong></em></span> rigger, <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Intial reaction:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;hostile<br />An old friend of Master Scourge with a large ugly nose and half an ear.</p>\n<p><strong>Jakes Magpie</strong><br /><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Stat:</strong></em></span> Male dwarf, <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Job:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;swab,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Intial reaction:</strong></em></span> hostile<br />A thief caught stealing from the quartermaster's store and sentenced to keelhauling on the character's first day.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"","_id":"caV9hW6xGSmrjttg"}
