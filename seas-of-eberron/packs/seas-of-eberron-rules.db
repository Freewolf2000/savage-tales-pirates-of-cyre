Sailors love a good sea chantey, and characters with @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Performance]{Performance} quickly find themselves popular members of the crew. If a character succeeds at a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Performance]{Performance} check, he gains a +1 bonus per @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{raise} to social checks made to interact with any listener among the crew for the next 24 hours, up to a maximum of +4. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failure}, however, indicates that the next time he attempts to use @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Performance]{Performance} to entertain the crew, everyone ignores him.</p>\n<h3>Gambling Games</h3>\n<p>Other recreations have two things in common: they are dangerous, and they are played for money. When betting on any of the following games, the minimum bet is 1 gp, and the maximum ready cash any sailor in the lesser crew is likely to have is 20 gp. Some people are bad losers&mdash;the ramifications of this are left for the GM to decide.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Arm Wrestling:</strong> Not merely typical arm wrestling bouts, such matches are usually conducted on a barrel top covered in broken glass, knives, or caltrops. Participants make opposed @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Strength} checks, with the higher result determining the winner, and the loser taking an level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} from @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Bumps and Bruises]{Bumps and Bruises} as his hand and arm are pushed onto whatever lies on the table.</li>\n<li><strong>Hog Lob: </strong>Participants lob a lead ingot covered in a greased piglet skin, the &ldquo;hog,&rdquo; as far across the deck as possible. This game is resolved by @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} checks between any number of players, who agree on a bet beforehand. The hog counts as an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Improvised Weapons]{improvised weapon}. Some pirates claim to have participated in games played against Devourer using a live hog.</li>\n<li><strong>Heave:</strong> This potentially deadly drinking game is played with rum and takes place between any number of pirates, who bet to predict the winner beforehand. Each pirate drinks a half pint of rum in one swig. Doing so forces participants to make a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Vigor} check &ndash;1 or take a level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}. This check increases by &ndash;1 for each consecutive drink. Pirates then take turns drinking until only one is left standing. Some tales tell of entire crews drinking themselves to death through this game, leaving ships of drunk ghosts wandering the shipping routes.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"9VlOO3cACSA2vHNI"}

He is Captain Redeker&rsquo;s second-in-command, and his word is law on deck. He takes an immediate dislike to the PCs and any friends they make among the crew. Dabrak is terrified of Captain Redeker, however, and has more things on his mind than just the PCs. He&rsquo;s suspicious of everyone on the crew, and while he grows to hate the PCs, he does not sully his hands with fighting them unless they attack him, in which case he fights with relish, calling on his allies for aid in dealing with the &ldquo;mutineers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dabrak is a figure to be hated, though the PCs have little opportunity to get their revenge at first. By the end of the adventure, however, the PCs finally have the opportunity to give him (and his toady, Master Scourge) their just rewards.</p>\n<h3>Master Scourge</h3>\n<p>Master Scourge is the Wormwood&rsquo;s boatswain and masterat-arms, and Mr. Plugg&rsquo;s right-hand man. As boatswain, he is in charge of all activities and sailors on deck, and as master-at-arms, he is responsible for discipline. Master Scourge is a sneering man with a braided beard and a mouth full of gold teeth. His body is tall and thin, and even his long coat and heavy boots fail to give any impression of strength or bulk. A sadistic coward, Scourge uses his association with Plugg as protection and in return has no morals when it comes to the tasks his master sets. He is bold and violent when the odds are stacked in his favor, happily kicking a dying dog in the street if asked to do so. But should that dog get up and bite, he quickly f lees.</p>\n<p>Master Scourge is a key villain in the early part of the adventure, and his whispered words further poison Mr. Plugg against the PCs. Scourge&rsquo;s relationship with the PCs is a crucial one. He immediately senses something out of the ordinary about them, and his dreams of rank and fortune soon begin to unravel. Like most bullies, Scourge is a coward at heart, and sets out to discredit and ultimately kill his rivals.</p>\n<p>This enmity is personal, and primarily directed at a single PC, though how this manifests is ultimately up to you. Scourge was recently rejected by Sandara Quinn (see page 56), and any object of her affections is sure to earn his jealousy and hatred. Likewise, Scourge might be jealous of a handsome and talented PC and fear for his own position on the ship. While Scourge focuses his hostility on one PC, he is also happy to intimidate and victimize the other PCs, as well as seeking to discredit the PCs&rsquo; friends. He avoids the PCs as a group, however, and immediately goes to Plugg&rsquo;s side if threatened. If actually attacked, he also goes to Plugg, who may have the PCs disciplined.</p>\n<p>Playing the bully requires you to temper the PCs&rsquo; anger while ensuring they recognize Scourge as a deadly enemy with far too many allies to simply be killed. Terrified as he is of Harrigan and having no desire to be keelhauled, Scourge won&rsquo;t try to kill the PCs&mdash;at least, not at first. Instead, he seeks to poison the other crew members against the PCs, and is likely to succeed with his own small band of admirers, whom the PCs will find hard to convert. In essence, this group becomes a rival adventuring party, but with one crucial difference: these rivals also enjoy the support of Mr. Plugg. It&rsquo;s not until events move on to the Man&rsquo;s Promise in Part Two that Plugg and Scourge decide to have done with the PCs, but they&rsquo;ll eventually get their comeuppance at the hands of the PCs in Part Three</p>\n<h3>Ambrose \"Fishguts\" Kroop</h3>\n<p>Ambrose Kroop is the ship&rsquo;s cook, nicknamed &ldquo;Fishguts&rdquo; by the crew, though whether this refers to the contents of his soups or the stains on his apron is unclear. His job is to bring the ship&rsquo;s biscuit on deck at dawn for the crew, and prepare and serve the evening meal. Kroop is a drunkard, but not constantly inebriated, and is a potential ally for the PCs. His unpredictability makes him a frustrating but ultimately useful friend. Like his friend Cut-Throat Grok, Kroop is from the school of hard knocks, but where Grok has become tough, Kroop has capitulated in the face of endless discipline and violence. However, as the adventure progresses and he becomes closer to the PCs, he becomes an increasingly useful ally.</p>\n<p>While Kroop is indifferent to the PCs at the beginning of the adventure, he is, at heart, a friendly salt, and soon becomes attached to any character who makes a modicum of effort as the cook&rsquo;s mate. In general, Kroop likes to cook and drink rum. He is usually insensibly drunk in his quarters during the evening, rarely venturing onto deck after serving the evening meal. Kroop&rsquo;s cook&rsquo;s mate gains a +2 bonus on all checks to inf luence the quartermaster Cut-Throat Grok. Kroop is also happy to lend his mate any equipment from the galley, though stealing it without his permission is easy enough.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"FJHhcYei8MYZlo2y"}

Growing up among pirates is tough for anyone unusual, and Grok got her scar fighting a gang of cutthroats in the alleys of Port Peril who robbed her and left her for dead when she was only 11 years old. Grok is a reedy half-orc who favors dark clothing. She carries a notched greataxe and an array of throwing axes hangs from her belt. Grok frequently grins toothily, and uses appalling curse words, particularly when drunk. Grok is renowned for being tough, and she doesn&rsquo;t suffer fools, but she is a close friend of Ambrose Kroop, whom she sees as someone who&rsquo;s had even worse luck than she&rsquo;s had.</p>\n<p>Grok is usually found in the quartermaster&rsquo;s store (area A9) during the day. In the evenings, she locks the store and carouses on deck, drinking and gambling with the other pirates before returning to her cabin (area A7) to sleep it off.</p>\n<p>Grok loves unusual drink and fine songs, and a character who provides her with at least 20 gp worth of alcohol that isn&rsquo;t rum or who makes a successful DC 15 Perform (song) check gains a +4 bonus on all checks made to inf luence her. If Grok is made friendly, she allows the PCs into the quartermaster&rsquo;s store after normal hours, where PCs can negotiate for equipment with her with additional Diplomacy checks. Recovering a PC&rsquo;s starting equipment is considered simple aid (DC +0), a loan of goods worth up to 150 gp is considered lengthy aid (DC +5), and a loan of 300 gp worth of equipment is considered dangerous aid that could result in punishment, since she might get keelhauled herself for theft (DC +15).</p>\n<h3>Other Officers</h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">In addition to the major NPCs detailed on these pages, a number of other officers serve aboard the </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Wormwood</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Although most of these characters play little or no role in this adventure and cannot be inf luenced, the PCs may spot them aboard the ship or hear about them from their fellow pirates.

{"name":"Ship Roles","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_2fzh7f9etq5","path":"Seas of Eberron#/CF_SEP/The Wormwood","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Ship Roles</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>All crew members on any ship have specific roles and responsibilities, often with harsh punishments being meted out upon those who shirk their duties. Listed here are some of the standard roles aboard a typical ship. Not all of these roles might be represented on every vessel, but such details can help players understand their characters&rsquo; daily duties.</p>\n<h3>Artificer/Mage</h3>\n<p>Many ships that ply the waters around Khorvaire have an artificer or mage on board. They can be responsible for the functioning of any magical locomotion of the ship, repairs, general arcane knowledge or any number of other magical needs the ship might have. They are also expected to contribute firepower to any ship to ship conflicts that happen on the vessel.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Boatswain</h3>\n<p>The boatswain, or bosun (pronounced &ldquo;bosun&rdquo; either way), is responsible for the upper deck of the vessel and above. This makes the boatswain accountable for all rope, rigging, anchors, and sails. At the start of the day, the boatswain and those under her weigh anchor, raise the sails and report on the general condition of the ship&rsquo;s deck to the captain. As she oversees many of the ship&rsquo;s basic daily labors, the boatswain is often responsible for keeping discipline and dispensing punishment.</p>\n<h3>Cabin Boy/Girl</h3>\n<p>Servant to the captain and other officers, this low-ranking and typically young crew member assists other sailors in their duties and runs various errands across the ship, requiring him or her to gain a measure of understanding of almost all the ship&rsquo;s roles.</p>\n<h3>Captain</h3>\n<p>The ultimate authority on any ship, his word is law to all on board. The captain chooses where to sail, what are fitting punishments for breeches in discipline,&nbsp; and who fills the other stations aboard the vessel, among many other command decisions. Leadership can prove perilous, however, as a captain is, above all, meant to secure success for his ship and crew. Failing to do so increases the threat of mutiny.</p>\n<h3>Carpenter</h3>\n<p>No matter what enchantments or alchemical unguents augment a pirate ship, its heart and bones are still wood. This simple fact makes the carpenter one of the most important positions aboard any vessel. Carpenters are chief ly responsible for maintaining the ship below the deck, finding and plugging leaks, repairing damage, and replacing masts and yards.</p>\n<h3>Cook</h3>\n<p>While the quartermaster normally allocates the rations, the cook and his apprentices make and distribute meals to the crew. Although some better-outfitted vessels employ skilled cooks to attend to the captain and the officers, many cooks are drawn from crew members who have suffered crippling injuries, allowing them to still serve even after such trauma.</p>\n<h3>Healer</h3>\n<p>Many ships have a healer on board to tend to any injuries that happen. Whether this is a House Jorasco healer, Jorasco trained, or some herbalist with slight training in healing, depends on the vessel.</p>\n<h3>Master-at-Arms</h3>\n<p>Concerned with the security of the ship, the fitness of the crew, and the dispensing of justice, the master-at-arms typically is one of the most feared and dreaded of a ship&rsquo;s officers.</p>\n<h3>Master Gunner</h3>\n<p>The master gunner is in charge of all shipboard artillery, ensuring the weapons are kept in good working order and that the crew knows how to use them. She maintains the ballistas, catapults, and so on.</p>\n<h3>Quartermaster</h3>\n<p>The quartermaster oversees the supplies and items stored aboard the ship. She maintains the supplies of food and weaponry, oversees the disbursement of food to the cook, and doles out the rum ration to the crew.</p>\n<h3>Rigger</h3>\n<p>Riggers work the rigging and unfurl the sails. In battle, next to that of a boarding party, the riggers&rsquo; job is one of the most dangerous, as they pull enemy vessels near enough to board.</p>\n<h3>Swab</h3>\n<p>Any sailor who mops the decks. Also used as slang for any low-ranking or unskilled crew member.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"awi25kwR25zOMXzr"}

The following presents (in order of severity) the game effects of a variety of typical nautical punishments, which the PCs have the potential to face or inflict during their piratical careers. Most of these sentences are meted out just before the evening meal, at an event typically referred to as the bloody hour. Victims are tied to the whipping post on the main deck and their backs stripped for punishment&mdash;with penalties doubled for those who resist.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Rope Bash</h3>\n<p>Little more than an admonishment&mdash;and occasionally used as a sign of endearment&mdash;a rope bash is a single attack with the hefty, sealed end of a ship&rsquo;s rope.</p>\n<h3>The Lash</h3>\n<p>This is an attack using a whip. Lashes during bloody hour is typically just cause one level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}.</p>\n<h3>Cat-o&rsquo;-Nine-Tails</h3>\n<p>This is an attack using a cat-o&rsquo;-ninetails, also referred to simply as a cat&mdash;lashes with the cat cause one level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}.</p>\n<h3>Confined in the Sweatbox</h3>\n<p>A cramped metal box left on deck and exposed to the sun, a sweatbox is terribly confining and replicates unbearably hot conditions. Each four hours in the sweatbox the victim must make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Vigor} at &ndash;1 for each 8 hours they spend in the sweat box, or suffer a level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}. Any creature with fire resistance is immune to the effects of the sweatbox. Victims typically spend 8, 12 or even 24 hours locked up in the sweatbox.</p>\n<h3>Keelhauling</h3>\n<p>The most frightful of pirate punishments is keelhauling, as it generally ends in death&mdash;often by decapitation. Being keelhauled involves being tied to a rope looped over a ship&rsquo;s keel and dragged down one side of a ship, underwater across the barnacle encrusted hull, and up the other side. Keelhauling can be done either fast or slow. If done fast, the barnacles cut deep and flense the victim, dealing 2d6 points of damage per round. If done slow, shallower cuts are incurred, dealing 1d6 damage per round, but the risk of drowning increases. How long keelhauling takes typically depends on the vessel, with a keelhauling on a ship like the Wormwood taking 6 rounds if done fast and 12 rounds if done slow.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"uhUPupisUqsJ8Bb2"}

She also has a fouler mouth than all the crew put together. Rosie is from Cliffscrape, and like the characters was impressed onto the&nbsp;<em>Wormwood's</em>&nbsp;crew. She has been on the ship for over a week and has already made her mark threatening others who mess with her. She has a healthy hatred of Mr. Dabrak and Scourge. She loves food, drink, and tall tales. Anyone who provides her with any of those gains a +1 bonus to any check to influence her. She is missing her fiddle, and has been unable to convince Grok to give it back to her.

His appearance is that of someone pretending to be a pirate, rather than a true buccaneer. Conchobhar is a professional gambler who made the mistake of drinking with the&nbsp;<em>Wormwood&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;crew one night. He has been on ship less than 24 hours at the start of the adventure. Conchobhar is resigned to his fate but is determined to make the most of it, as he&rsquo;s always yearned for the sea anyway. One thing dominates Conchobhar&rsquo;s thinking&mdash;himself. Conchobhar is also a serial womanizer, and female characters gain a +1 bonus on all checks to influence him.

Cog gets pleasure from little other than combat and is quick to get into fistfights, whether because of a chance remark or simple bad luck. Cog actually volunteered to join the crew of the&nbsp;<em>Wormwood</em>. He has spent his first few days aboard stealing and secreting away goods for barter. Cog loves dark tales. A character that can succeed on telling a dark tale to Cog will gain a +1 bonus on checks to influence Cog. Characters who are fighters and favor muscle over talk, interspursing their talk with grisly details will gain a +1 bonus to influence Cog. However, a failed check is likely to elicit a violent response from the angry sailor.</p>\n<h3>Sador Chumlett</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Stat:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;Male orc,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Job:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;swab,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Intial reaction:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;unfriendly<br />A fat, pushy bully with a shaved head.</p>\n<h3>Jaundiced Sudak</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Stat:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;Female dwarf,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Job:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;swab,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Intial reaction:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;hostile<br />A humorless, greedy mute.</p>\n<h3>Maheem</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Stat:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;Male human,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Job:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;rigger,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Intial reaction:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;hostile<br />A big man with a permanent scowl.</p>\n<h3>Slippery Syl</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Stat:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;Male dwarf,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Job:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;rigger,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Intial reaction:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;hostile<br />An unhinged murderer who fled to sea to escape the gallows.</p>\n<h3>Tam \"Narwhal\" Tate</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Stat:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;Male dwarf,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Job:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;rigger,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Intial reaction:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;hostile<br />An old friend of Master Scourge with a large ugly nose and half an ear.</p>\n<h3>Jakes Magpie</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Stat:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;Male dwarf,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Job:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;swab,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>Intial reaction:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;hostile<br />A thief caught stealing from the quartermaster's store and sentenced to keelhauling on the character's first day.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"irB21HUo5OkZlAtn"}

The following presents (in order of severity) the game effects of a variety of typical nautical punishments, which the PCs have the potential to face or inflict during their piratical careers. Most of these sentences are meted out just before the evening meal, at an event typically referred to as the bloody hour. Victims are tied to the whipping post on the main deck and their backs stripped for punishment&mdash;with penalties doubled for those who resist.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Rope Bash</h3>\n<p>Little more than an admonishment&mdash;and occasionally used as a sign of endearment&mdash;a rope bash is a single attack with the hefty, sealed end of a ship&rsquo;s rope.</p>\n<h3>The Lash</h3>\n<p>This is an attack using a whip. Lashes during bloody hour is typically just cause one level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}.</p>\n<h3>Cat-o&rsquo;-Nine-Tails</h3>\n<p>This is an attack using a cat-o&rsquo;-ninetails, also referred to simply as a cat&mdash;lashes with the cat cause one level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}.</p>\n<h3>Confined in the Sweatbox</h3>\n<p>A cramped metal box left on deck and exposed to the sun, a sweatbox is terribly confining and replicates unbearably hot conditions. Each four hours in the sweatbox the victim must make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Traits]{Vigor} at &ndash;1 for each 8 hours they spend in the sweat box, or suffer a level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}. Any creature with fire resistance is immune to the effects of the sweatbox. Victims typically spend 8, 12 or even 24 hours locked up in the sweatbox.</p>\n<h3>Keelhauling</h3>\n<p>The most frightful of pirate punishments is keelhauling, as it generally ends in death&mdash;often by decapitation. Being keelhauled involves being tied to a rope looped over a ship&rsquo;s keel and dragged down one side of a ship, underwater across the barnacle encrusted hull, and up the other side. Keelhauling can be done either fast or slow. If done fast, the barnacles cut deep and flense the victim, dealing 2d6 points of damage per round. If done slow, shallower cuts are incurred, dealing 1d6 damage per round, but the risk of drowning increases. How long keelhauling takes typically depends on the vessel, with a keelhauling on a ship like the Wormwood taking 6 rounds if done fast and 12 rounds if done slow.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"xMoJCYS3QhlKtV09"}
{"name":"Ship Roles","permission":{"default":0,"DX8acFfCTTwwzgWq":3},"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}},"cf":{"id":"temp_gkbi6ipop4j","path":"Seas of Eberron Tales#/CF_SEP/The Wormwood","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<div class=\"swade-core savage-eberron-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Ship Roles</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>All crew members on any ship have specific roles and responsibilities, often with harsh punishments being meted out upon those who shirk their duties. Listed here are some of the standard roles aboard a typical ship. Not all of these roles might be represented on every vessel, but such details can help players understand their characters&rsquo; daily duties.</p>\n<h3>Artificer/Mage</h3>\n<p>Many ships that ply the waters around Khorvaire have an artificer or mage on board. They can be responsible for the functioning of any magical locomotion of the ship, repairs, general arcane knowledge or any number of other magical needs the ship might have. They are also expected to contribute firepower to any ship to ship conflicts that happen on the vessel.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Boatswain</h3>\n<p>The boatswain, or bosun (pronounced &ldquo;bosun&rdquo; either way), is responsible for the upper deck of the vessel and above. This makes the boatswain accountable for all rope, rigging, anchors, and sails. At the start of the day, the boatswain and those under her weigh anchor, raise the sails and report on the general condition of the ship&rsquo;s deck to the captain. As she oversees many of the ship&rsquo;s basic daily labors, the boatswain is often responsible for keeping discipline and dispensing punishment.</p>\n<h3>Cabin Boy/Girl</h3>\n<p>Servant to the captain and other officers, this low-ranking and typically young crew member assists other sailors in their duties and runs various errands across the ship, requiring him or her to gain a measure of understanding of almost all the ship&rsquo;s roles.</p>\n<h3>Captain</h3>\n<p>The ultimate authority on any ship, his word is law to all on board. The captain chooses where to sail, what are fitting punishments for breeches in discipline,&nbsp; and who fills the other stations aboard the vessel, among many other command decisions. Leadership can prove perilous, however, as a captain is, above all, meant to secure success for his ship and crew. Failing to do so increases the threat of mutiny.</p>\n<h3>Carpenter</h3>\n<p>No matter what enchantments or alchemical unguents augment a pirate ship, its heart and bones are still wood. This simple fact makes the carpenter one of the most important positions aboard any vessel. Carpenters are chief ly responsible for maintaining the ship below the deck, finding and plugging leaks, repairing damage, and replacing masts and yards.</p>\n<h3>Cook</h3>\n<p>While the quartermaster normally allocates the rations, the cook and his apprentices make and distribute meals to the crew. Although some better-outfitted vessels employ skilled cooks to attend to the captain and the officers, many cooks are drawn from crew members who have suffered crippling injuries, allowing them to still serve even after such trauma.</p>\n<h3>Healer</h3>\n<p>Many ships have a healer on board to tend to any injuries that happen. Whether this is a House Jorasco healer, Jorasco trained, or some herbalist with slight training in healing, depends on the vessel.</p>\n<h3>Master-at-Arms</h3>\n<p>Concerned with the security of the ship, the fitness of the crew, and the dispensing of justice, the master-at-arms typically is one of the most feared and dreaded of a ship&rsquo;s officers.</p>\n<h3>Master Gunner</h3>\n<p>The master gunner is in charge of all shipboard artillery, ensuring the weapons are kept in good working order and that the crew knows how to use them. She maintains the ballistas, catapults, and so on.</p>\n<h3>Quartermaster</h3>\n<p>The quartermaster oversees the supplies and items stored aboard the ship. She maintains the supplies of food and weaponry, oversees the disbursement of food to the cook, and doles out the rum ration to the crew.</p>\n<h3>Rigger</h3>\n<p>Riggers work the rigging and unfurl the sails. In battle, next to that of a boarding party, the riggers&rsquo; job is one of the most dangerous, as they pull enemy vessels near enough to board.</p>\n<h3>Swab</h3>\n<p>Any sailor who mops the decks. Also used as slang for any low-ranking or unskilled crew member.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"4WhIpeBOuB8BqSfp"}
